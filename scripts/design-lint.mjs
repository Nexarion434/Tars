// Design guardrail: fails when banned styling creeps back in.
//
// Every rule reads the .ts, .tsx and .css files under src/: class names live in
// constants as well as in markup, and an @apply can carry a shadow or a raw
// colour into a stylesheet.
//
// The Node port of scripts/design-lint.sh, which needed bash and grep (on
// Windows, `bash` is the WSL launcher). Same six rules, written as the same
// POSIX extended regular expressions grep -E took, same exemptions, same lines
// printed, same exit codes. What it keeps of grep, on purpose:
//   - it walks src/ as grep -r does: directory order, depth first, symbolic
//     links met inside src/ not followed, regular files named *.ts, *.tsx or
//     *.css only;
//   - it reads bytes: a line ends at \n and nothing else, a NUL is text (grep
//     -a), and a line it prints is the file's own bytes, minus NULs, which the
//     shell's $(...) used to drop;
//   - the character classes are ASCII, as grep's are in the C.UTF-8 locale Git
//     Bash runs it in, measured on 2026-09-25: é next to a # is not [:alnum:].
//
// grep answered in three ways, and only one of them was a pass: 0 found a line,
// 1 found none, 2 could not search. Until 17/09 the shell script threw grep's
// errors away and read "no line left" as a pass: a src/ that did not exist, a
// pattern grep refused and a violation in a file grep could not open all
// printed five green ticks. Each of them fails here, and says so in grep's
// words, "(grep exited 2)", so that the output reads as it always did.
