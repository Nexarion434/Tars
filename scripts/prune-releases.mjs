/**
 * Keep the current build and the one before it in the main checkout's release/,
 * and delete an older version only once GitHub proves it is published.
 *
 * `electron-builder` never cleans up after itself, so every build left another
 * 430MB in release/ and the directory reached 6.3GB across thirteen versions.
 * Two are kept rather than one so a bad release can be compared against, or
 * handed to someone, without a rebuild; two and not three, Noah's rule of
 * 2026-10-01.
 *
 * Two rules the 1.7.1 release got around, and that this file now enforces
 * instead of assuming:
 *
 * - **The folder is the main checkout's release/**, the one Noah opens, found
 *   through git from wherever this runs, a worktree included. It used to be
 *   release/ of the current directory: 1.7.0 and 1.7.1 were built in a
 *   worktree, the purge there saw two versions and did nothing, and the real
 *   folder stayed on 1.6.19 with 1.6.17 and 1.6.18 still in it. The current
 *   directory is never the default; tests name their folder explicitly.
 * - **A version is deleted only with proof it is published**: a release
 *   `v<version>` on the repository of `build.publish` carrying its dmg and its
 *   zip, the same size and, where GitHub gives a digest, the same bytes as the
 *   local files. This comment used to say every version was published, and
 *   nothing checked it: 1.6.19 was not, and the next purge would have deleted
 *   its last copy. When the proof cannot be had at all (gh missing, logged out,
 *   offline, an API error), nothing is deleted, the build still succeeds, and
 *   every version kept for that reason is named.
 *
 * Only the versioned artifacts are touched. `latest-mac.yml` is the updater's
 * manifest for the current version, `mac-arm64/` is the unpacked app, and
 * neither accumulates.
