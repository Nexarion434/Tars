/**
 * `npm run build:renderer`, and the first step of `npm run electron:build`: the
 * renderer as a static export, for packaging. It replaces this, which neither
 * cmd.exe nor PowerShell can run (and whose `bash`, on Windows, is WSL's):
 *
 *   set -e
 *   rm -rf .next out
 *   mv src/app/api src/app/_api_backup
 *   mv src/app/icon.tsx src/app/_icon_backup.tsx 2>/dev/null || true
 *   trap "mv src/app/_api_backup src/app/api; mv src/app/_icon_backup.tsx src/app/icon.tsx" EXIT
 *   ELECTRON_BUILD=1 next build
 *
 * next.config.ts switches to `output: 'export'` under ELECTRON_BUILD=1, and a
 * static export can hold neither route handlers nor a dynamic icon: both wait
 * aside while next build runs, and come back however it ends. The same steps,
 * in the same order, and the same exit code: next build's own, or, when a
 * signal stopped it, death by that same signal. Where it does more than the
 * shell did, it is where the shell lost work without a word:
 *   - an interrupted build (Ctrl+C, SIGTERM, a closed terminal) puts them back
 *     only once next build has stopped, and on POSIX a signal sent to this
 *     process alone is passed on to next build, which the shell left running;
 *   - a backup left by a build killed outright (SIGKILL: nothing can put it
 *     back) stops the build before anything moves. The shell moved
 *     src/app/api inside it;
 *   - a restore that fails is reported and fails the build. The shell's mv
 *     nested the folder or failed silently, and exited 0.
 *
 * Tested in __tests__/scripts/build-renderer.test.ts.
