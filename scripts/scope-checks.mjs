/**
 * Decide whether this change can have moved a rendered surface, and run the
 * end to end suite only when it can.
 *
 * The suite starts a Next server, launches Electron and walks thirty five
 * surfaces: about three minutes, against a few seconds for both tsc passes and
 * forty five for the unit tests. Running it after a change that could not
 * possibly have altered a pixel is most of the cost of a review round for
 * nothing.
 *
 * The rule is an allowlist, not a denylist, and that direction is the whole
 * point: a path this file has never heard of runs the suite. Missing a visual
 * regression costs incomparably more than three minutes, so every doubt,
 * including a brand new directory nobody has classified yet, resolves towards
 * running.
 *
 * Note what is deliberately NOT on the allowlist. `electron/` is not, even
 * though its files are not the renderer: the suite boots the real application
 * against a seeded home directory, so what a surface displays comes through
 * real main process code. window-manager.ts decides how the window is created,
 * preload.ts is the renderer's whole contract, and the services behind Chat and
 * Usage decide what those pages have to show. An electron change absolutely
 * can move a screenshot, and has.
