"""tars-relay: what the plugin decides and keeps, with no Hermes import, so that it is tested on its own.

Tars sends Noah its questions, reports and Sentry requests through Hermes's Telegram bot. Noah's replies to those
messages, and the messages he starts with "@project" for a project Tars registered here, are kept for Tars, which
reads them through the dashboard routes; Hermes's model never gets them. The model gets a read-only copy of what Tars sent, attached to
Noah's next turn in his private chat and marked as Tars's, so that he can ask Hermes about it. It can neither act
on the copy nor answer it for him: an answer only reaches Tars when Noah himself replies on Telegram.

Two Hermes processes share the store: the gateway (it records replies and gives the copies) and the dashboard (it
records what was sent and hands replies to Tars). Hence SQLite, which locks across processes, rather than files
rewritten in place.
