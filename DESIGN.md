## Overview

Tars runs twenty agents at once. The screen is a wall of live terminals, agent
cards, cost figures and diffs, and the interface's whole job is to get out of
the way of that data. So: flat surfaces, no shadows, no gradients, a single 2px
radius, and colour reserved for things that mean something: an agent's state,
money, an accent on the one control you are meant to press.

Depth is done with value, not elevation. Four greys stack in dark
(`bg` → `surface` → `surface-raised` → `surface-elevated`, 18 → 26 → 34 → 38 in
sRGB) and a 1px `border` line separates anything the greys don't. A card is a
rectangle with a hairline around it. It never lifts off the page.

Three families, three jobs. **Instrument Serif** carries the page title and the
wordmark and nothing else: it is the only warm thing on the screen and it earns
its place by being rare. **Roboto Condensed** is the UI: it fits more label into
a 240px sidebar and a narrow table column than an unnarrowed grotesque, which is
the whole argument for it. **Roboto Mono** is for anything the machine wrote: branch
names, paths, model ids, versions, token counts. The terminal is the one exception:
xterm is handed `JetBrains Mono, Menlo, Monaco, Courier New, monospace` directly.

Dark is the launch default (`<html class="dark">` in `src/app/layout.tsx`, with
an inline script that reads `localStorage['tars-theme']` before first paint so a
cold start never flashes white). Light is a full peer, not a tint: every token
has a light value, and both are checked against the same contrast floor.

## Colors

The tokens live in `src/app/globals.css`: light on `:root`, dark on `.dark`,
re-exported to Tailwind through `@theme inline`.

| Token | Dark | Light | CSS variable(s) | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `bg` | `#121212` | `#FAF9F7` | `--background`, `--bg-primary` | The page behind everything |
| `surface` | `#1A1A1A` | `#FFFFFF` | `--card`, `--popover`, `--bg-secondary` | Cards, sidebar, panels, menus |
| `surface-raised` | `#222222` | `#F3F1EE` | `--secondary`, `--muted`, `--bg-tertiary` (and `--input`, dark only, light `--input` is `#FFFFFF`) | Field fills, chips, skeleton bars |
| `surface-elevated` | `#262626` | `#FFFFFF` | `--bg-elevated` | The one step above a card |
| `term-bg` | `#0F0F0F` | `#F3F1EE` | `--term-bg` | Nominally the terminal canvas: nothing reads it; xterm carries its own literals |
| `border` | `#2A2A2A` | `#DAD6CE` | `--border`, `--border-primary` | Every hairline |
| `border-strong` | `#3A3A3A` | `#BFBAB1` | `--border-accent` | Hover edges, scrollbar thumb |
| `text-primary` | `#F5F4F2` | `#1E1E1E` | `--foreground`, `--text-primary` | Titles, values, active labels |
| `text-secondary` | `#9B9B9B` | `#4A4A4A` | `--muted-foreground`, `--text-secondary` | Subtitles, inactive labels |
| `text-muted` | `#898989` | `#6B6B6B` | `--text-muted` | Meta, timestamps, hints |
| `accent` | `#FF9E42` | `#C77012` | `--primary`, `--accent`, `--ring`, `--info` | The mark, one CTA, focus ring |
| `accent-dim` | `#FF9E42` @ 8.6% | `#C77012` @ 7.8% | `bg-primary/…` | Active-item fill |
| `on-accent` | `#1E1E1E` | `#1E1E1E` | `--primary-foreground` | Text on an accent fill |
| `status-running` | `#4CC38A` | `#1A7F37` | `--success` | Agent working |
| `status-waiting` | `#E8C547` | `#9A6700` | `--warning` | Agent asking |
| `status-error` | `#E5534B` | `#CF222E` | `--danger`, `--destructive` | Agent failed, destructive action |
| `status-idle` | `#898989` | `#6B6B6B` | `--color-status-idle` → `--text-muted` | Agent spawned, doing nothing |

Two colours are deliberately not what the Pencil frames drew:

- **`text-muted` dark.** The frames use `#727272`. That is 3.62:1 on a card and
  3.31:1 on a field: under AA for the 10-12px it is always used at. The code
  lifts it to `#898989`, the darkest value that still clears 4.5:1 on `bg`, `surface`
  **and** `surface-raised` at once (5.36 / 4.98 / 4.55): on a dark ground anything
  lighter passes too, so this is the floor, not the ceiling.
- **`status-idle`.** The frames drew it at `#727272` dark and `#9B9B9B` light;
  the light one is 2.64:1 on `bg`. The token is bound to `text-muted` instead,
  which is the same visual read and passes in both themes.

### Contrast, measured

Every ratio below is computed from the shipped hex values, not copied from a
comment. AA (4.5:1) is the floor for all body and control text.

**Dark**: text on `bg` / `surface` / `surface-raised` / `term-bg`:

| Colour | `#121212` | `#1A1A1A` | `#222222` | `#0F0F0F` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `text-primary` | 17.04 | 15.83 | 14.47 | 17.44 |
| `text-secondary` | 6.74 | 6.26 | 5.72 | 6.90 |
| `text-muted` | 5.36 | 4.98 | 4.55 | 5.48 |
| `accent` | 9.12 | 8.47 | 7.74 | 9.33 |
| `status-running` | 8.46 | 7.86 | 7.18 | 8.65 |
| `status-waiting` | 11.16 | 10.37 | 9.48 | 11.42 |
| `status-error` | 5.06 | 4.70 | 4.30 | 5.18 |

**Light**: text on `bg` / `surface` / `surface-raised`:

| Colour | `#FAF9F7` | `#FFFFFF` | `#F3F1EE` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `text-primary` | 15.84 | 16.67 | 14.79 |
| `text-secondary` | 8.42 | 8.86 | 7.86 |
| `text-muted` | 5.06 | 5.33 | 4.73 |
| `accent` | 3.47 | 3.65 | 3.24 |
| `status-running` | 4.83 | 5.08 | 4.51 |
| `status-waiting` | 4.63 | 4.87 | 4.32 |
| `status-error` | 5.09 | 5.36 | 4.75 |

Fills, and the two numbers that decide the light theme:

- `on-accent` on `accent`: **8.11:1** dark, **4.57:1** light. White on `#C77012`
  is 3.65:1 and fails, which is why `--primary-foreground` is `#1E1E1E` in both
  themes. (The frames draw the dark button's label at `#121212`, 9.12:1; the code
  uses `#1E1E1E`. Either passes; the code value is canonical.)
- `text-primary` on an `accent-dim` fill: 13.53:1 dark (`#2E261E` over `surface`),
  15.28:1 light (`#FBF4EC` over `surface`). The active nav item is legible because
  of its text colour, not its fill.
- **Light `accent` never carries body text.** 3.47:1 on `bg` clears the 3:1 large-text
  threshold and nothing else. In light it is a fill, a border, and a 24px+ figure.
  A 12px orange label in light is a bug.
- `StatusBadge` puts its own colour at 10% behind itself, which costs roughly half
  a point: dark error lands at 4.22:1, light warning at 4.29:1, light info at 3.26:1.
  Badges are therefore always redundant: the same state is on the dot and in the
  row's text. Never put the only copy of a message inside one.

## Typography

The scale, in px: **9, 9.5, 10, 10.5, 11, 11.5, 12, 12.5, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18,
20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44.** Nothing between the steps, nothing below 9.

| Size | Family | Where |
|---|---|---|
| 36 | display | Splash wordmark |
| 24 | display | Page title (`PageHeader`) |
| 20 | display | Sidebar wordmark (16 in the mobile top bar) |
| 14 | ui | Body default (`body { font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5 }`), standard `ui/Button` |
| 13 | term-mono | Terminal (`xterm` `fontSize: 13`, JetBrains Mono) |
| 12.5 | ui | Page subtitle |
| 12 | ui / mono | Fields, dropdowns, badges, `sm` buttons, table cells |
| 11 | ui | Dense controls, dialog footers |
| 10.5 | mono | The detail line under a slow operation |
| 10 | ui | Section labels (uppercase), dropdown hints |
| 9 | ui | Smallest counters |

`Roboto Condensed`, `Roboto Mono` and `Instrument Serif` are pulled through
`next/font/google` in `src/app/layout.tsx` and self-hosted at build time, so
there is no runtime request to Google and the app types correctly offline.
They bind to `--font-sans-loaded` / `--font-mono-loaded` / `--font-serif-loaded`,
which `@theme inline` maps to `--font-sans` / `--font-mono` / `--font-serif`.

Serif is applied only through `.font-serif`: headings default to the UI family.
Body copy runs `letter-spacing: 0.01em` and `font-feature-settings: "ss01","ss02","cv01"`.
`td`, `th`, `code` and `pre` get `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`, so a
column of costs or token counts never jitters as it updates.

Two `text-[8px]` survivors, in `src/components/Sidebar.tsx` and
`src/app/usage/page.tsx`, are below the scale's floor and are the only
exceptions in the tree. Don't add a third.

## Layout & Spacing

The shell is identical on all sixty-odd frames.

- **Sidebar: 240px** (72 collapsed). `surface` fill, `border` on its right edge.
  Brand at the top (10px square + wordmark), under a 32px empty strip that is
  where macOS draws the close, minimise and zoom buttons: the window is
  `hiddenInset`, so that corner belongs to the system and nothing of ours may
  be placed in it. The nav starts at y=86. Then in the middle the nav, then a
  What's new row and a connection line (a green dot and the word `Connected`,
  no port and no mono) and below those the Settings link and the Light/Dark
  toggle, which are what actually sit at the very bottom.
- **Header.** A 24px serif title, a 12.5px subtitle in `text-secondary` saying
  what the screen is for, and the page's actions right-aligned on the same block.
  `ui/PageHeader` carries only its own `pb-3.5`; the 22px top gutter is the page
  container's job, and 22 + title + 2 + subtitle + 14 is where the 84 comes from.
  It is written and mounted nowhere (no page imports it) so no 84px header
  ships today and every screen still rolls its own heading.
- **Content: padding 24 on all four sides** at desktop, 16 below `lg`
  (`p-4 lg:p-6 pb-6` on the main element). So the left edge of content is
  x=264 with the sidebar open: 240 + 24.
- **Status bar** at the foot of the terminal grid, not the content column
  (`TerminalsView/components/StatusBar.tsx`): the agent count and the per-state
  counts (running, waiting, idle, error) on the left, the total output-line
  count on the right. No branch, no spend, no tokens, no gateway.

The spacing step is **8**: the terminal grid's gap is 8, and card grids and
section stacks are multiples of it. Inside a component the steps are 2, 4, 6, 8,
10, 12, 14, 16, 20, 24. The shell's 24 gutter is on the step; the sidebar's own
`px-6` / `px-5` (24 / 20) are the only shell values worth looking up.

Control heights are **26 (small)** and **32 (standard)**. There is no third
height. A padding-driven height drifts with its content (an icon makes a button
taller than the word beside it) so `ui/Button` and `ui/Field` both hard-code
`h-[26px]` / `h-8` and a field sits flush with the button next to it.

## Components

Everything that defines raw appearance is meant to live in `src/components/ui/`.
That is the rule `scripts/design-lint.sh` protects: it greps `src/` for banned
styling and excludes exactly two paths, `src/components/ui/` and `app/icon.tsx`.

The migration behind the rule is barely started. Two files in the whole tree
import a primitive: `src/app/crons/page.tsx` (`LoadingState`) and
`src/components/NewChatModal/MembersTable.tsx` (`Dropdown`). `Button`,
`Label`/`Input`/`Select`/`Textarea`, `PageHeader`, `StatusBadge` and `StatusDot`
have no consumers at all, and the `Toggle` primitive still lives at
`src/components/Settings/Toggle.tsx`, outside `ui/`. Read this section as the
target, not as an inventory of what the screens do today.

### Buttons: `ui/Button`
Four variants, two sizes, nothing else. `primary` is an accent fill with
`on-accent` text; `secondary` is `surface` with a `border`; `ghost` is
`text-secondary` with a transparent border; `danger` is red text on a 40% red
border, no fill. Every variant carries a border (transparent where it should
not show) because a fill with no border renders 2px shorter than the outlined
button beside it and no two buttons in a row share an edge.

One primary per screen, and nothing claims it yet: `variant="primary"` appears
nowhere in `src/`, and `src/components/Dashboard/index.tsx` renders no button at
all, only a heading and a dynamic import of `TerminalsView`.

### Fields: `ui/Field`
`Label`, `Input`, `PasswordInput`, `Select`, `Textarea` and `FieldError`. 32px
tall, `surface-raised` fill, 1px `border`, 12px text, `border` → `accent @ 40%`
on focus. Pass `error` and the border goes `danger`; pair it with a `FieldError`
caption (one short 11px line of red text under the field), never a tooltip.

### Dropdown: `ui/Dropdown`
The themed replacement for `<select>`. A native select renders its popup through
the OS and ignores the palette entirely, so every model picker looked like a
stock macOS menu; this draws the list itself on `surface` with a `border`, a
lucide `check` on the selected row, and an optional right-aligned hint (price
per million, model id). Closes on outside mousedown and on Escape. The panel is
as wide as its own content, at least as wide as the trigger and at most 24rem:
sized to the trigger alone it left the model picker in a team's member grid too
narrow to read a model name in, and uncapped a long label would widen the page.

### Tabs and the segmented control
Project tabs on the Dashboard: the active tab is a `surface` box against the
`bg` strip. `ui/Button`'s `active` prop is the segmented cell: a 26px cell whose
border darkens to `border-strong` over a `surface-raised` fill, never an accent
fill. Nothing uses it yet. The seven layout presets
(`single 2-col 2-row 2x2 3x2 3x3 focus`, in `TerminalsView/constants.ts`) ship as
a chevron dropdown in `LayoutPresetSelector.tsx`, not a row; and there is no
`Dark Light System` picker anywhere: the sidebar has a single Light/Dark toggle
button and `Settings/TerminalSection.tsx` offers two cards for the *terminal*
theme, dark and light. Where state is shown, it is the box. There is no
underline and no bar.

### Toggle
A 40×20 track with a 14×14 square knob and a 2px inset. On: `accent` track and
border, an `on-accent` knob, knob right. Off: `surface-raised` track, a
`text-secondary` knob, knob left. Square, like everything else. It lives at
`src/components/Settings/Toggle.tsx`, outside `ui/`, and the `--knob` variable
drawn for it is unused.

### Cards and panels
`surface` fill, 1px `border`, 2px radius, no shadow. An agent card is: a 40px
(`w-10 h-10`) tile holding the agent's emoji (or a spinner while it runs), the
name with its provider icon inline, a `rounded-full` status pill and a single
`Pencil` edit button right-aligned, one line of task text in `text-muted`, then
a row of chips (project, local model, branch, skills). No status square, and no
open/stop row.

### Terminal panes
A `surface-raised` header (`px-3 py-1.5`, no fixed height): emoji avatar, agent
name, status pill, project name, the first 8 characters of the session id in
mono, and Play/Stop, Clear, Fullscreen and Close icon buttons, over a terminal
body. The `⋯` is a right-click context menu, not a glyph. xterm gets its palette
as a JS object rather than from CSS variables, and there are two of them:
`src/components/Terminal.tsx` draws on `#0D0B08`, while `TERMINAL_THEME` in
`src/components/AgentWorld/constants.ts` (re-exported by `TerminalsView`) draws
on `#1a1a2e` and `TERMINAL_THEME_LIGHT` on `#FFFFFF`. It is the one surface the
tokens don't reach, and the one place the pre-fork teal (`#3D9B94`) survives.

### Status dots and badges: `ui/StatusBadge`
The frames draw the agent mark as a 6px **square**, in the state's colour: the
same shape as the brand mark, one size down. `ui/StatusBadge` still ships
`StatusDot` as a 6px circle; that is the only round shape left in the app, and
it is tolerated at 6px and nowhere larger. `StatusBadge` is a bordered pill of
the tone's colour at 10% fill / 25% border. Five tones: success, warning,
danger, info, neutral. No raw colours anywhere else.

### Modals
Full-bleed `scrim`, then a `surface` panel with a `border`. Header band: serif
title, subtitle, divider. Footer band: divider, cancel on the left, the
forward action on the right, the primary last. Multi-step dialogs (New agent →
Project / Model / Tools / Task) put a row of step markers under the header: 28px
numbered circles joined by 40px connector lines, the reached ones filled
`text-primary` with `bg` as their numeral, the current one also ringed. They are
round, against the rule.

### Loading: `ui/Loading`
Three stages, because a spinner that shows for 200ms is a flash and one that
spins for eight seconds says nothing:

1. **Under 400ms: nothing.** No spinner, no flash.
2. **400ms-3s: a skeleton in the real shape of the content.** `surface-raised`
   bars inside real bordered rows, so the layout does not jump when data lands.
3. **Past 3s: name what is slow.** `SquarePulse`, one line saying what is being
   waited on (`Still reading the Hermes gateway…`), the endpoint and elapsed
   seconds in 10.5px mono, and a Cancel button.

The launch sequence uses the same vocabulary: the 4×4 `SquareGrid` fills through
three steps (reading your projects, detecting providers, connecting to Hermes),
then the wordmark fades in. The steps advance on fixed `setTimeout` timers
260ms apart (the main process reports nothing) so it is reassurance, not
progress.

## Do's and Don'ts

- **Don't use an accent rule.** Never a 2px orange bar to the left of, or under,
  an active item. Active state is carried by the *box*: an `accent-dim` fill for
  nav and menu rows, or `surface` + `border` for tabs and segmented cells. The
  label of an active nav item should stay `text-primary`: measured off the frames,
  the active and inactive rows differ only by fill and by `text-primary` vs
  `text-secondary`. `Sidebar.tsx` does neither: nav rows, What's New and Settings
  all render active as `bg-primary/20 text-primary`, a 20% accent fill under an
  orange label, which in light also fails contrast. `Dropdown` is the one that
  reads right, at `bg-primary/10` with `bg-primary/5` on hover. Orange rules and
  orange labels are AI design slop.
- **Don't use `>_` as a mark.** The mark is an orange **square**. Loaders and the
  app icon are a 4×4 grid of them that fills. `src/components/Brand.tsx` is the
  single source of the identity: rebranding is editing that file and the OS icon,
  nothing else.
- **Don't add a shadow.** `scripts/design-lint.sh` fails on `shadow-sm|md|lg|xl|2xl`,
  and `globals.css` neutralises anything matching `[class*="shadow-"]` with
  `box-shadow: none !important`. The dead `.card-hover` / `.hover-lift` /
  `.shadow-elevated` utilities at the bottom of `globals.css` are pre-fork Dorothy
  leftovers: `.card-hover` and `.card-accent` still carry its teal
  (`rgba(61, 155, 148, …)`), while `.hover-lift` and `.shadow-elevated` carry a
  warm brown shadow (`rgba(44, 36, 24, …)`). Unused, and not to be revived.
- **Don't use a gradient.** Lint fails on `bg-gradient`.
- **Don't set a radius inline.** Lint fails on `style={{ borderRadius`. Radius
  comes from the theme: 2px on buttons, inputs, selects, and every `.rounded-*`
  class the app still carries. `rounded-full` is meant to survive only on dots and
  avatars under 12px, and it has not held: the agent card's status pill
  (`AgentCard.tsx:118`), the sidebar's 20px badge counters and the New-agent step
  circles are all round today. Each is a bug, not a precedent.
- **Don't use a raw Tailwind palette colour.** Lint fails on
  `(text|bg|border)-(red|green|blue|amber|purple|cyan|yellow|orange|zinc|slate|gray)-[0-9]`.
  Use the tokens. Tailwind's `cyan-*` scale is remapped to the tangerine ramp in
  `@theme inline` precisely so old teal classes degrade into the brand instead of
  into a wrong colour.
- **Don't animate for decoration.** Lint fails on `animate-ping`. The intended vocabulary is
  `fade-in`, `slide-up`, `square-pulse`, and 150ms colour transitions on
  interactive elements, and the tree does not keep to it: `animate-spin` occurs
  100 times and `animate-pulse` 13, against one `animate-fade-in` and one
  `animate-slide-up`, and `globals.css` carries a `pulse-subtle` keyframe nothing
  uses.
- **Do define appearance only in `src/components/ui/`.** Everything else should
  compose those primitives; today two files do, and closing that gap is the
  standing job. Run `npm run lint:design` before you push.
- **Do give every data surface all five states**: loading (the three-stage
  ladder), empty, error, needs-sign-in, permission-denied.
- **Do keep the focus ring.** `*:focus-visible` is `2px solid var(--primary)` at
  `outline-offset: 2px`, on both themes. Removing an outline without replacing it
  is not a style choice.
- **Do check both themes.** A token has two values or it isn't a token. The theme
  class is toggled on `<html>`; nothing reads a media query.

## Iconography

[lucide](https://lucide.dev) (`lucide-react`), at 12px (`w-3 h-3`) in dense
controls and 16px (`w-4 h-4`) at standard size: 204 and 267 occurrences, the two
that carry the app. A third size leaked in and stayed: 20px (`w-5 h-5`, 75
occurrences) is every sidebar nav icon and the agent-card status glyphs. Default
stroke, coloured with `text-secondary` or `text-muted` and lifting to
`text-primary` on hover. Used in the frames: `chevron-down` (dropdowns), `check`
(selected row), `menu` / `x` (mobile sidebar), `download` / `external-link` /
`rotate-cw` (updater), `loader-2`, which is meant to be updater-only, the app's
own waiting state being the square pulse, but is imported by 49 files today,
including `AgentList/AgentCard.tsx`, where it is the running-agent spinner.

**The grey squares in the Pencil exports are placeholders, not a specification.**
Every sidebar entry, settings group, menu row and provider row in
`design/exports/` shows a flat grey square where an icon belongs. They stand for
"an icon goes here"; they are not squares-as-icons and they are not the brand
mark. Pick the lucide glyph that names the thing.

Provider marks are the exception: Claude, Codex, Gemini, Grok and the rest keep
their own logos. `src/components/ProviderBadge.tsx` renders them from one
registry (`src/lib/providers.ts`) at 14px (`w-3.5 h-3.5`): most as inline SVG
on `currentColor` so they inherit the row's text colour, a few as bitmap assets
from `public/` where the vendor mark is not reducible to a single path.
