/**
 * The Dashboard's signature of the agents its panels show: the panels are
 * handed a new list only when this string changes (TerminalsView/index.tsx).
 *
 * NUL-joined, same reasoning as agentProjectPathsKey there: currentTask is
 * free text (the prompt the agent was launched with), so a visible delimiter
 * could in principle appear inside a field and fold two different agent lists
 * into the same key. NUL is the one byte none of these fields can contain.
 * `error` is in it because the panel header shows it: a field the panel reads
 * and the key leaves out is a field that can change without the panel ever
 * hearing of it. `name` and `role` for the same reason: the header draws the
 * agent's mark from both, and the Claude account it runs on, its pin and the
 * last move by Tars, which its account control names and tells. A permission
 * question Tars holds and the call it is about, which the panel's line names
 * and answers: ask in terminal takes the question away and moves nothing else.
 * Since when it is asleep and who is waking it, which the header's line says
 * (#322).
