 * live output, and the stored transcript replayed when a panel mounts, which
 * armed mouse tracking on sessions that had exited long ago.
 *
 * Once xterm honours those, it calls `selectionService.disable()` and takes the
 * wheel over to encode it as a mouse report - so the viewport never scrolls,
 * nothing is selectable, and the reports go out to the pty as stray
 * `\x1b[<35;48;1M` text. These panels are a monitoring board, not a full
 * emulator: scrollback and selection are worth more here than app-side mouse
 * support, so the modes are swallowed in the parser.
 *
 * Registered handlers run before the built-in one and `true` stops the
 * sequence, so the mode is never set. Mixed sets that also carry an unrelated
 * mode are passed through rather than dropped wholesale.

 * ahead of xterm's own, which sits on that element in the bubble phase, and

 * adds up into lines, so dropping every event also drops the sum, inertia

 * scroll: once `stopWheelTyping` stopped the wheel typing arrows there, the
 * wheel did nothing at all. Claude Code scrolls its conversation on wheel
 * reports, and asks for them as it starts, on every resize and again when
 * input reaches it (`?1000h ?1002h ?1003h ?1006h`). `suppressMouseTracking`
 * still keeps the mouse from xterm, so clicks, drags, selection and
 * Option+click stay here; only the wheel goes to the program, encoded as xterm
 * would have encoded it: SGR, button 64 up and 65 down, the cell under the
 * pointer, Alt and Ctrl added.
 *
 * One report per line of travel, measured the way xterm measures its own
 * scroll: pixels over the row height, the remainder carried to the next event.
 * Claude Code moves one line per report here. It moves three for xterm.js, but
 * it recognises xterm.js by the reply to XTVERSION, which xterm 5.3 never
 * sends, and one report per event moved a mouse notch a single line.
 *
 * Only when the program asked for tracking with SGR reports, and xterm is not
 * tracking the mouse itself (a mixed mode set it let through). Otherwise the
 * wheel is `stopWheelTyping`'s: stopped where it would type arrows, left to
 * xterm where there is history to scroll. Use it instead of `stopWheelTyping`
 * on a terminal that forwards to a CLI, after `suppressMouseTracking`, right
 * after `term.open()`.
 *
 * The request is read from the output this terminal parsed. A panel rebuilt
 * from stored output that no longer reaches back to it (a long turn with no
 * input fills the stored chunks) forwards nothing until Claude Code asks again,
 * at the next key or resize.
 *
 * Measured with Claude Code 2.1.273, in a Dashboard panel and in fullscreen:
 * the conversation scrolls back to its first line, no line is cut or
 * overlapped on any screen, and a round trip through fullscreen keeps it so.
