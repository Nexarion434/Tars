/**
 * What a permission question Tars holds says, wherever it is shown: a panel's
 * line under its header, the top of the agent window's terminal column, the
 * card's task line. Since PR 318 a Claude agent that runs the state mod asks
 * Tars, not its terminal, before a call Claude Code would put to its dialog:
 * it reads `waiting` with `permissionAsk` set, which names what the call
 * acts on, whole (`subject`, electron/services/permission-asks.ts). Frame:
 * `Permission asked of Tars` in design/tars-redesign.pen. Its failures are listed, and pinned, in
 * __tests__/lib/permission-ask.test.ts.

 * must be what was read. The reason and the rule are Claude Code's, kept
