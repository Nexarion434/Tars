# Security notes

What Tars defends against, what it does not, and which of the two a given
change is. Measured, dated, and written down when the measurement says a
defence is not one: a lid that reads like a boundary is worse than an open door
nobody mistook for closed.

Everything here was measured on Noah's machine, macOS 26.6.1 (Darwin 25.6.0),
on `main` at `b17db0f`, between the 17th and the 18th of September 2026, except
where a passage names `bad8c97`: the first version of the 1.7.6 work, which an
audit read on the 18th and found holes in.

---

## 1. The threat this app actually has

One user account. One person. Every agent Tars starts runs as that person, with
that person's shell, that person's keychain and that person's files. Nothing in
the API, in a file mode or in a `--add-dir` flag changes that, because none of
them is enforced against a process that simply opens the file.

So there are two different questions, and they are answered in two different
places:

- **Which agent is this, and may it do that?** A question about mistakes and
  about crossing wires: an orchestrator picking the wrong id out of a global
  listing, an MCP client that started without a token, a browser tab reaching
  `127.0.0.1`. This is answerable, and the local API answers it.
- **Can agent A obtain what agent B holds?** A question about isolation. On one
  user account, with no sandbox, the answer is yes, always, whatever the API
  does. It is not answerable by a check in a route.

Confusing the two is how a defence becomes theatre. The rest of this file keeps
them apart.

---

## 2. What the local API decides (and what it cannot)

Since the identity work of 1.7.x an agent is named by the token Tars minted for
its process, never by a header. Since 1.7.6 the routes that **drive** an agent
(start, dispatch, run-task, stop, message, delete, and create) refuse a caller
that is nobody, and the Hermes webhook, which drives one too, opens to Hermes
alone:

| Credential | Who it is | What it opens |
|---|---|---|
| An agent's token (`CLAUDE_MGR_API_TOKEN`, minted in memory per terminal and per ACP run) | that agent | its own project's agents, and a new agent in its own project, never an orchestrator (`POST /api/agents` refuses the role to every caller: only the Agents page makes one); another project's only with `allowCrossProject`. Not the webhook |
| Tars's own pass (minted in memory, written nowhere) | the main process | every agent of every project: it is Noah's super chat, which drives every project by design. Not the webhook |
| `~/.tars-private/hermes-webhook-secret` | Hermes | `POST /api/webhooks/hermes` and nothing else, and through it any agent of any project, named by id or by name |
| `~/.dorothy/api-token`, the shared token | nobody | reads, and the exempt routes. It drives no agent, and does not open the webhook |

Measured before the change, on `b17db0f`: a call presenting the shared token
with **no** `x-tars-client` header stopped, started, dispatched to and DELETEd
an agent of any project and got a `200`. The guard refused only a caller that
*volunteered* `x-tars-client: mcp`, which is a header the caller writes about
itself. Every agent can read that token file, so the fleet was open to any of
them; it could not simply be refused, because the super chat authenticated the
same way. It no longer does.

Measured again on `bad8c97`, the first version of that change, by the audit that
read it: the webhook still let the shared token drive the fleet. It took the
master token as a fallback, "so an existing setup keeps running"; with no secret
file it skipped its own check altogether, so an agent's own token went through
too; and it hands its target to `performDispatch`, which checks nothing, after
resolving it by name across every project. The shared token with a secret
configured, and the shared token or an agent's token with none, each got a
`200` and had the message typed into the agent it named, the agent's token into
another project's. The route now opens to the webhook secret and to nothing
else, and no secret configured means no way in. The same audit found creation
held to an identity but not to a project, while the table above already said
its own project: an agent created one in any project it named, with a `200`.
Creation now follows the rule the other routes follow.

**What this is.** A guard against mistakes, and against a *casual* reader of the
token file. It is not isolation: see §3.

**What it leaves open, deliberately.** The read routes (`GET /api/agents`, and
per-agent status, output, health, wait, bootstrap) still accept the shared
token. So a process holding that file can still enumerate the fleet and read any
agent's terminal output. The hooks no longer need it: since 2026-09-23 they
present the token of the CLI they run in, for the bootstrap and memory reads and
on `/api/hooks/*`, where nothing else is accepted (below). Closing the reads to
the shared token is now a change to routes only.

**What the hook routes take.** `/api/hooks/*` sets an agent's status and output and
registers the session that owns it, so until 2026-09-23 anybody on the loopback could
post for any agent with no credential: the Audit registered one agent's session for
another and got its conversation back through a restart (`--resume`), and a killed
CLI's late SessionStart took its agent from the live session by accident. The hooks
run inside the agent's CLI and inherit its `CLAUDE_MGR_API_TOKEN`, minted for that
terminal: a post now carries it, and the route takes nothing else (not the shared
token, not Tars's pass, not the token of a delegated ACP run, which names the agent
too) and only for the `agent_id` it names. The Audit's gate of #135 posted a
SessionStart with a run's token: it registered a session over the live terminal's,
which then had every post refused as stale. A terminal replaced by a restart or a new
start, or one that has ended, takes its token with it: the old CLI's late posts are a
401, where a stopped CLI's token used to last until the agent's next launch.
Upgrading from 1.7.9: quitting kills every agent terminal, so no CLI started by 1.7.9
outlives the update, and each is relaunched with a token and the new scripts (they sit
in the app bundle). One that survives anyway posts without a token, or with one this
Tars never minted, and is refused: stop and start it from Tars. The hook logs moved
from `/tmp` (readable by every user, shared by every Tars on the machine) to
`~/.dorothy/logs/`, `0600`, and Tars removes the two old files at startup
(`removeLegacyHookLogs`): only regular files the user owns, and only when `HOME` is the
user's own, so a sandbox never deletes the logs of a Tars still on 1.7.9 beside it.

**What the webhook secret is.** The reach of Noah's own chat, handed to Hermes,
so it lives where Noah's conversation lives, in `~/.tars-private`, and not in
`~/.dorothy`, where it was minted until 1.7.6. It moves at the first start that
finds it there, value unchanged, so a Hermes job that holds it keeps working.
That takes it out of the directory every agent is pointed at. It does not take
it out of an agent's reach: an agent that goes looking reads `~/.tars-private`
like any other file of Noah's (§1, §5), and with the secret drives any agent of
any project through the webhook. And an agent that read it before the move
still has it. Rotating it is deleting `~/.tars-private/hermes-webhook-secret`,
opening Settings > Hermes, which mints a new one, and giving Hermes that.

---

## 3. An agent's token is not secret from the other agents

`CLAUDE_MGR_API_TOKEN` travels to the CLI, and from the CLI to every MCP server
it starts, in the environment. The environment of a process is readable by any
other process of the same user.

Measured on 2026-09-18: six live `mcp-orchestrator` node processes on this
machine, every one of them exposing `CLAUDE_MGR_API_TOKEN` and
`CLAUDE_AGENT_ID` to `ps -Eww`. A canary in a `node` process is readable; the
same canary in `/bin/sleep` is not, because Apple's platform binaries hide
theirs and neither `claude` nor `node` is one.

Four parades were considered, and **none was written**:

| Parade | What it would do | Measured verdict |
|---|---|---|
| A `0600` file instead of the environment | | Moves it. Every agent runs as the same user, so `cat` reads it. `~/.dorothy/api-token` is already `0600` and is exactly the secret this replaced |
| An inherited file descriptor | Pass the token on an fd rather than in the environment | Not implementable. Tars starts the CLI through `node-pty`, whose `spawn` inherits the tty and nothing else, and the token has to reach the MCP servers, which the **CLI** starts, from its own environment. There is no fd route that does not go through Claude Code |
| A one-shot token exchanged at startup | Redeem the environment token once for a session token held in memory | Breaks the fleet. The same variable is what a respawned MCP server and the shell hooks present later; spending it on first use logs them out. And a sibling can read it before it is spent: a race, not a boundary |
| A unix socket per agent | Address the API through a per-agent socket | Moves it. The socket path is in the same environment, and filesystem permissions are per user, so any agent of that user connects. macOS has no abstract socket namespace |

And the sandbox, which is the one that sounds like it would work:

**It does not.** Measured under the strictest `sandbox-exec` profile in §4, a
five-line Python calling `sysctl KERN_PROCARGS2` still read another process's
environment. `(deny sysctl-read (sysctl-name "kern.procargs2"))` does not stop
it. `(deny process-info*)` does not stop it either, and kills the reader's own
interpreter, `git` and `npm` with it; `(deny process-info* (target others))`
leaves the toolchain alive and still does not stop it. What every profile does
stop is `/bin/ps`, which is setuid root and therefore cannot be executed under
any sandbox at all: the convenient route is closed, the syscall behind it is
not.

**The honest statement.** Per-agent tokens ended impersonation *by naming*: an
agent can no longer become a colleague by writing a header. They do not, and
cannot, end impersonation by a process that reads the process table. Closing
that needs agents in separate user accounts, or separate VMs. It is not a
line of TypeScript, and nothing in this repo pretends otherwise.

---

## 4. A sandbox for a Tars agent: what it would really buy

Noah decides this; nothing here is implemented, and no agent is confined by
anything Tars ships today. This is the measurement, so the decision has numbers
under it.

`claude` runs unconfined: its Bash reads everything Noah reads. `--add-dir` sets
**tool permissions**, not an access boundary, and on this machine 37 of the 42
agents in the fleet run with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, where the flag
decides nothing at all.

### What was measured

A real `claude` (2.1.273), under `sandbox-exec`, on a disposable project, with a
disposable HOME and the login keychain reached by symlink. Its own report, in
full:

```
1. hello.txt - written successfully, contains `confined`.
2. git status --short - succeeded: `?? f.txt` and `?? hello.txt`
3. ls /Users/noah/Documents - failed: ls: /Users/noah/Documents: Operation not permitted
4. ps -Eww -p 39401 - failed: (eval):1: operation not permitted: ps
```

So: it did its work, and it could not read Noah's home. Separately measured
under the same profile: `~/.dorothy/api-token` denied, `/Users/noah/tars`
denied, the loopback API reachable, `api.anthropic.com` reachable, `git`,
`node` and `npm` working.

### The profile that does it

This is the one the run above was made under, with `PROJECT` the agent's
working directory and `AGENTHOME` its HOME. It is not a proposal to adopt as
written: it is what it took to get a working agent, so that the cost is
visible.

```scheme
(version 1)
(deny default)

; --- what any program needs to start at all -------------------------------
(allow process-exec process-fork)
(allow file-map-executable)
(allow file-read-metadata)
(allow signal (target self))
(allow sysctl-read)
(allow mach-lookup)
(allow ipc-posix-shm)
(allow file-ioctl)

; --- the system, read only -------------------------------------------------
(allow file-read* (literal "/")
                  (subpath "/usr") (subpath "/bin") (subpath "/sbin")
                  (subpath "/System") (subpath "/Library") (subpath "/opt")
                  (subpath "/private/etc") (subpath "/private/var/db")
                  (subpath "/private/var/select") (subpath "/dev")
                  (subpath "/Applications"))
(allow file-write-data (literal "/dev/null") (literal "/dev/tty") (literal "/dev/dtracehelper"))

; --- the toolchain, wherever the user installed it -------------------------
; On this machine node, npm and claude itself all live under $HOME, so a
; profile that allows only /usr and /opt starts nothing.
(allow file-read* (subpath "/Users/noah/.nvm")
                  (subpath "/Users/noah/.local/bin")
                  (subpath "/Users/noah/.local/share/claude")
                  (subpath "/Users/noah/.config/git")
                  (literal "/Users/noah/.gitconfig")
                  (literal "/Users/noah/.gitignore_global")
                  (literal "/Users/noah/.npmrc"))

; --- the credential store -------------------------------------------------
; Measured: without this the CLI answers "Not logged in · Please run /login".
; The OAuth token lives in the login keychain, so a profile that walls off the
; user's Library walls off the agent's own account with it.
(allow file-read* file-write* (subpath "/Users/noah/Library/Keychains"))

; --- the agent's own world, read and write ---------------------------------
(allow file-read* file-write* (subpath "PROJECT"))
(allow file-read* file-write* (subpath "AGENTHOME"))
(allow file-read* file-write* (subpath "/private/tmp") (subpath "/private/var/folders"))

; --- the network: the model, and Tars on the loopback ----------------------
(allow network-outbound)
(allow network-bind (local ip "localhost:*"))
```

What it took to get there, none of it obvious:

- `(deny default)` plus a list of allowed subpaths **is not enough for `/bin/sh`
  to run**: it also reads the root directory, so `(literal "/")` is required.
  Without it every command dies at exec with no message.
- The toolchain has to be named, because on this machine it lives under `$HOME`:
  `~/.nvm` (node and npm), `~/.local/bin` and `~/.local/share/claude` (the CLI
  itself). A profile allowing only `/usr` and `/opt` starts nothing.
- `git` reads `~/.gitconfig` and `~/.config/git/ignore`. Denied, it fails
  outright on the first and warns on the second.
- **The credential store has to be allowed.** Without
  `~/Library/Keychains`, the CLI answers `Not logged in - Please run /login`.
  A profile that walls off the user's `Library` walls off the agent's account
  with it.
- The network can be allowed or denied, and not much in between:
  `network-outbound` filters take an `ip "host:port"`, not a DNS name, so
  "only api.anthropic.com" is not expressible. Loopback-only was measured:
  the model becomes unreachable (`curl` to Anthropic returns nothing at all).
- A `(deny …)` rule is an `EPERM` by default and a kill with
  `(with send-signal SIGKILL)`. The kill matters when the caller swallows the
  error; `log show` does not report these refusals, so it is no use as a
  detector.

### What Noah gains

- An agent cannot read `~/Documents`, `~/.ssh`, another project's source, or
  `~/.dorothy` (the fleet's settings, every provider API key, the shared token,
  the vault). Measured, not assumed.
- An agent cannot write outside its project and the paths it is given. That is
  the failure mode with teeth: a confused agent `rm -rf`ing the wrong tree.
- It is per agent and per profile, so a read-only reviewer agent is expressible.

### What Noah loses

- **`ps` stops working entirely**, in every profile, confined or not, because it
  is setuid root. An agent debugging a stuck process loses its tool.
- Every path an agent legitimately needs must be named in advance: a second
  project, a worktree elsewhere, a scratch directory, a global npm cache. A
  missing path is a refusal, and often a silent one.
- `sandbox-exec` is deprecated by Apple. It works on macOS 26.6.1 and has worked
  for a decade; it carries no promise about the next release.
- Nothing may wrap the E2E suite in it: Chromium installs its own sandbox and a
  process already confined fails to start.
- **It does not close §3.** An agent under this profile still reads a
  colleague's token out of the process table. The sandbox is a filesystem
  boundary, not a process boundary.

### The shape it would take in Tars, if Noah wants it

`initAgentPty` is the one line every PTY starts on. A confined spawn would be
`sandbox-exec -f <profile> <the command it already builds>`, with the profile
written per agent next to its worktree from a template: the project path, the
worktree, the agent's own scratch, plus the fixed system and toolchain block
above. Opt-in per agent, defaulting to off, or every existing agent breaks on
the first path nobody thought to list.

---

## 5. What is where on disk

| Path | Holds | Reachable by an agent |
|---|---|---|
| `~/.dorothy/` | the fleet, settings, the shared token, the vault, the bus journal, the Hermes gateway's token (`hermes-connection.json`), and the files staged for a room (`bus-files/`, a week, then removed) | Yes, deliberately: it is in every agent's `--add-dir`. A file sent to one room can be read by every agent of every project, as its journal can; `bus-files/` is refused when it is a link, and each file is written in a folder of its own that must not exist yet |
| `~/.tars-private/` | Noah's conversation with the super chat, the Hermes sessions it held that conversation in (`overseer-hermes-sessions.json`), and the Hermes webhook secret | Not handed to any agent, never passed to a CLI, and refused by both ways an agent has of sending a file to Telegram and by the vault's attach route. Each file `0600`, in a directory Tars makes `0700`. The conversation also lives in Hermes, one session per turn: `memory_search` (`/api/memory/search`, what agents call) leaves out every session the super chat opened, every run of its cron job and any hit that names no session. Sessions opened before 1.9.0 were not recorded, so only their cron runs are left out; an agent holding `hermes-connection.json` can still ask the gateway itself (§5, the paragraph below) |

So what the kanban tools let an agent do on the Hermes board (since #183, delete
only a task it filed that nobody claimed, or one it claimed) is a rule of Tars's
own tools, not a barrier: an agent that reads `hermes-connection.json` can call
the gateway with its token and edit or delete any task (the audit's gate of #183).

What an agent waits on (`waitingOn`, the command or question of an open dialog) is kept in memory only: it is not written to `agents.json`. While the dialog is open, another agent can read it through `GET /api/agents/:id?full=true`, as it can read the rest of that agent's record; a command typed with a secret in it is visible there for that long. The hook sends only the fields that name the dialog, each cut at 1000 characters, never a tool's whole input.

`~/.tars-private/overseer.json` used to be `~/.dorothy/overseer.json`: 148,654
bytes, 344 messages, mode `0644`, in the directory every agent is pointed at.
Reading it took no API call and no token.

Moving it is worth exactly what it is worth, and no more: it leaves the
directory an agent is handed and the listing it gets for free, and the `0600`
closes it to the other accounts on the machine. An agent that goes looking for
`~/.tars-private` still reads it, because §1. Closing that is §4, or nothing.

The move first took it off a list, which the audit of `bad8c97` caught on the
app's Telegram send routes, and which held for the agents' Telegram MCP server
too: both refuse `~/.dorothy` by name, and refused nothing under
`~/.tars-private`, so the conversation could be sent from where it had landed
with one call. Both refuse the private directory now. The vault's attach route
was a third way, measured on the same branch: it copies the file its caller
names into `~/.dorothy/vault/attachments`, where `/api/local-file` serves it
with no token, and it took a file from `~/.tars-private` on the shared token.
It refuses the private directory now too, by what the file is and not by how
it is named: on 2026-09-23 the audit's lead #21 was reproduced in a sandbox
app, where `~/.TARS-PRIVATE/...` (the volume ignores case) and
`/System/Volumes/Data/...` (the Data volume's firmlink) both copied the webhook
secret in and `/api/local-file` served it. The route and the app's Telegram send
routes now compare the real path, and each directory above it, with the private
directory by device and inode (`electron/utils/path-identity.ts`), so a case
variant, the firmlink or a symlink is refused like the plain name; the agents'
Telegram MCP server compares segments in any case and checks the real path too.
A hard link has no path back to the file it names, so a link made elsewhere to
a private file passed all of that; all three guards now look for its inode among
the files of the private directory, and the two Telegram ones in `~/.ssh` as
well (the audit's gate of #137).
It still copies any other file its caller names, `~/.ssh` included; that is older than 1.7.6, and closing it means
deciding what an agent may attach. Each of these is a refusal of the one-call
route, not a wall: an agent with a shell copies the file somewhere else first,
because §1.

Made on a new install by the first save, the directory came out `0755`, since
only the migration asked for `0700`. Whichever write makes it now, the
migration or the first save of the conversation or of the webhook secret, makes
it `0700`. A directory that already exists at another mode is left as it is.

## 6. Who the bots answer

Each bot is a way into the fleet from outside the machine, so each answers a
list Noah keeps in Settings, and nobody when the list is empty.

- **Telegram**: the chats enrolled with `/auth <token>`. Read from the settings
  as they are at each message: before 2026-09-23 the bot held the object it was
  started with, every Settings save replaced main's, and a chat removed or a
  token regenerated kept working until a restart (the audit's lead #19). The
  app's own `/api/telegram/send*` go only to those chats, as mcp-telegram's do:
  `send_telegram`, in every agent, forwarded a chat id chosen by the model
  (lead #20). And what the bot sends of its own accord, the super agent's
  replies and errors and the status notices, goes only to a chat Settings
  allows at the moment it is sent: the chat that last asked was remembered and
  never checked again, so a chat removed after asking kept receiving all three
  (the audit's gate of #137). It is forgotten now, and what it would have
  received goes to the chats that are allowed. Since 2026-09-24, `/auth` takes
  five wrong tokens from a chat, and twenty from all chats together, in any
  fifteen minutes (the Audit's gate of #176); past that it answers "Too many
  attempts" without comparing, the same to a right token as to a wrong one. The
  token Tars generates is 128 random bits: the limit is for a token set by hand,
  and against a bot that answers a stranger for ever. The count from all chats
  is a lock-out anyone who finds the bot can cause: twenty wrong tokens in
  fifteen minutes keep every new chat out, Noah's included (chats already
  enrolled are not affected). Kept for 1.9.0 on purpose (the Audit's gate of
  #200), with its way out said in the refusal itself: "Try again at HH:MM, or
  turn Telegram off and on in Tars's Settings". The toggle restarts the bot,
  which starts the count again. Only toggling Telegram in Settings or
  restarting Tars clears it: the count lives in memory, no API route restarts
  the bot and nothing watches app-settings.json.
- **Slack**: the member ids in Settings > Slack (`slackAllowedUserIds`). Before
  it, anyone who could mention or message the bot could list agents and project
  paths, start, stop and brief them, and move the channel agents post to
  (lead #15). A sender not on the list is told its own id, in a mention or a
  direct message, so the owner can add it; other channel messages are ignored
  without a word.
- **Discord**: the user ids in Settings > Discord (`discordAllowedUserIds`), and
  in a server channel only a message that mentions the bot, unless Require
  @mention is off. A stranger is told its id where it addressed the bot. Nothing
  the bot posts can ping (`allowedMentions` with nothing in it). Its invite asks
  for View Channels and Send Messages and nothing else: until the Audit's gate
  of #195 it asked for Read Message History too, which the bot never uses.

## 7. Windows

Measured on Nicolas's machine, Windows 11 Pro 26200, on the fork's `windows`
branch at `4b26873f`, on the 25th of September 2026. §1 holds there
unchanged: one account, every agent runs as it. What differs is what stands
in for the POSIX modes, and where the credentials of other programs live.

**No file mode is a boundary on Windows.** Every `0o600`, `0o700` and `chmod`
in this file's §5 and in `electron/utils/secret-file.ts` does nothing there:
Node maps `chmod` to the read-only attribute and nothing else, so
`app-settings.json`, `api-token`, `~/.tars-private` and its files come out
with whatever the folder above them hands down. What protects them is the
profile's access list. `C:\Users\<name>` grants SYSTEM, the Administrators
group and the account itself, nobody else, and a file under it inherits that:
another standard account on the machine cannot open it. A file Tars writes
outside the profile (a project on another drive, `C:\tmp`) has whatever that
place grants, often every authenticated user.

The profile's list is not always the one that applies. On this machine
`~\.dorothy` carries an entry of its own, not inherited, that grants read to
`CodexSandboxUsers` on the folder and everything created in it (`icacls`,
2026-09-25: `CodexSandboxUsers:(OI)(CI)(RX)`), put there by something other
than Tars. So `api-token` and `app-settings.json`, which would be `0600` on a
Mac, are readable by that group's accounts here. Tars neither made that entry
nor checks for one. The entries on `~\.dorothy` are `icacls
"%USERPROFILE%\.dorothy"` away, and `icacls <file> /inheritance:r /grant:r
"%USERNAME%:F"` would narrow one file to its owner. Tars does not run that
today: nothing yet shows that every reader of those files (the app, the hooks,
the seven MCP servers, a CLI in a sandbox of its own) still opens them
afterwards, and a Codex sandbox that reads `~\.dorothy` may be exactly the
reader that entry is for.

**Credentials that are not dotfiles.** Both ways an agent has of sending a file
to Telegram (the app's `/api/telegram/send-*` routes and the Telegram MCP
server) refuse the home's dotfiles by name (§5). Windows programs keep theirs
under `%APPDATA%` and `%LOCALAPPDATA%` instead, and until this lot both guards
sent them: the GitHub CLI's `hosts.yml`, gcloud's `credentials.db`, the
browsers' profiles (cookies, saved passwords), DPAPI's master keys
(`Microsoft\Protect`, which decrypt the rest), the Credential Manager's files,
Tars's own Electron profile (`%APPDATA%\tars`). Both guards refuse those now,
without regard to case, where the variables point and in their default place
(`electron/platform/credential-stores.ts`, the server's copy held equal to it by
a test). The list is of stores, not of every program: a tool that keeps a token
somewhere else in AppData is not on it. macOS has the same gap in `~/Library`
(Keychains, browser profiles, Tars's own profile), left as it was.

**The notification sound was a way to run code.** Its path is read from
`app-settings.json`, which every agent can write (§5), and Windows played it by
pasting the path into PowerShell code: a file named with a `'` ran what
followed, in a process the main process started (measured with a canary file:
the old command ran it). The path now reaches a fixed, encoded script as data,
in the environment, never in the code; only an existing local `.wav` is played,
a UNC path is refused before it is opened (the lookup alone would send the
account's NTLM hash to that host), and PowerShell is System32's, by its full
path, with no profile (`electron/platform/sound.ts`).

**Replacing a file someone is reading.** The atomic writes (§5, ETHOS 7) end in
a rename over the live file, which Windows refuses while any process has it
open, even to read. They are tried again for about a second and then fail with
a message that names the file and says it may be held open by another program
(`electron/platform/rename-replacing.ts`); `agents.json` goes the same way. What
that buys depends on the machine's load, and was measured under twenty reading
processes: a plain rename failed 198 times in 200 on this machine idle, and 16
to 25 times in 60 at 51 to 82% CPU, where the retrying writes failed 0 times in
60 each (three runs, 2026-09-25). Four hundred retrying writes all landed on
the idle machine; at 73% CPU the reviewer measured 110 of 400 failing after
their second. A save can therefore still fail on a busy machine, with an error
that says so; no reader ever saw a partial file.
