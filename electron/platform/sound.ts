 * How Windows plays a notification sound (audit B N-06), as a program and its
 * arguments, never a command line built from the file.
 *
 * The file's path comes from app-settings.json, which sits in ~/.dorothy, the
 * directory every agent is handed. It used to be pasted into PowerShell code
 * (`(New-Object Media.SoundPlayer '<path>').PlaySync()`), so a `'` in a file
 * name ended the string and the rest ran. Here the script is one fixed text,
 * passed base64-encoded (-EncodedCommand, so no quoting rule applies to it
 * either), and the path reaches it as data, in the TARS_SOUND_FILE variable.
 *
 * Refused before anything starts: a path that is not a local absolute
 * `X:\...` one (a UNC path would be opened, and opening it sends the
 * account's NTLM hash to that host; `\\?\`, relative and drive-relative paths
 * have no business here), a control character, anything but `.wav` (the only
 * format SoundPlayer plays), and a file that is not there. PowerShell is
 * System32's, by its full path, with no profile: never a `powershell` found on
 * the PATH or in the working directory.
