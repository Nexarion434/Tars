 * What the app owns that its agents are not handed.

 * Every agent is started with `--add-dir ~/.dorothy`: the directory holds the
 * Tars CLAUDE.md they are meant to read and the vault they are meant to write,
 * so it is handed over deliberately. Noah's own conversation with the super
 * chat was in it too, in clear, and reading it took no API call and no token -
 * an `ls` of the directory the agent was given, and a `cat`.
 *
 * So there is a second directory, and the difference between the two is the
 * whole of its documentation: `.dorothy` is what agents work in, this is what
 * they have no business in. Nothing here is ever passed to a CLI.
 *
 * What it is not. `--add-dir` sets tool permissions, not an access boundary,
 * and on this machine 37 of 42 agents run with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
 * anyway: an agent that goes looking still reads any file its user can read,
 * here as anywhere else in $HOME. What moving the file out does is take it out
 * of the directory an agent is pointed at, off the listing it gets for free,
 * and out of reach of anything that walks `~/.dorothy` on purpose. Closing the
 * rest takes a sandbox, not a path.
