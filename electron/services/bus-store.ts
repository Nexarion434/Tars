 * The bus journal: rooms, threads, messages and deliveries.
 *
 * One JSON file under ~/.dorothy, written the way agents.json is (temp file
 * then rename, through the shared writeAtomicSync). No new service, no
 * database, no network: a room is a view over the fleet Tars already has, and
 * only the journal and the membership overrides are persisted.
 *
 * Rooms are derived rather than stored. There is one `global` room, whose
 * members are the orchestrators, and one room per project that has agents,
 * whose members are that project's agents. A room keeps its `projectPath`, so
 * its id is `project:<path>` verbatim: Claude Code's directory encoding
 * (slashes and dots to dashes) is lossy and two projects can collide in it,
 * and an id that cannot be read back is not worth the shortening.
 *
 * The global room is today's super chat and stays it: its messages are read
 * from the overseer's own conversation through an injected reader, never
 * copied into this journal. Two stores for one conversation would drift, and
 * the overseer's behaviour does not change in v1.
 *
 * What this file does NOT do is deliver. Recording that a message is `queued`
 * is not writing it into a session: the queue is agent-watch.ts, generalised
 * separately, and a delivery row says exactly what has happened and no more.
