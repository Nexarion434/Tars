/**
 * Where the user's messages through the relay go (DESIGN-RELAIS-HERMES-V2.md, step 2; Noah's rule of 2026-10-01:
 * only a project's orchestrator talks to Hermes, and gets the user's replies).
 *
 * - A reply to a report, or to a message a project's orchestrator sent the user, goes to that project's orchestrator.
 * - "@project text" goes to that project's orchestrator; a name no project has, one two projects share, or a project
 *   with no orchestrator gets the user the list, or a word, and reaches nobody. The plugin keeps "@name" only for the
 *   fleet's projects, which the relay registers with it at every change.
 * - A reply to a word from Tars reaches nobody: the user is told how to reach an orchestrator.
 * - A reply to a question goes to the agent that asked (user-questions.ts registers it); to a Sentry request, to
 *   Tars itself: the error triage takes the user's go-ahead (error-triage.ts registers it).
 *
 * Each goes after the line "Message from the user via Telegram:", which only Tars writes, and holds the user's own
 * words: never the report or the message they answer, written from agents' output and page titles. A worker is
 * never typed a message under that line.
