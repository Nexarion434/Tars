/**
 * The project folders a CLI keeps (`~/.claude/projects` and the like), with the
 * path each one stands for, read without blocking the main process.
 *
 * Decoding a folder name back to its path is what costs: Claude Code writes
 * every character but letters and digits as `-`, so decodeProjectPath tries
 * the separators against the disk, segment by segment. On Noah's 27 folders that was 101 ms of
 * existsSync, and fs:list-projects (Dashboard, Agents, Projects, Brain),
 * memory:list-projects, fs:read-project-files and the project scan of
 * claude:getData each paid it again on every call: 104 to 397 ms per call,
 * measured by the Audit on 2026-09-23.
 *
 * A folder's path is decoded once and kept. It is decoded again only when the
 * path it gave no longer exists, at most every REDECODE_MS: a folder whose
 * directory appears after it was first read (the decoder falls back to the
 * raw tokens for a path missing on disk) then gets its real path, and one
 * whose project was deleted costs a decode twice a minute, not every call.
