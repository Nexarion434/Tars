/**
 * Keeps the agent CLIs Tars runs up to date, so a model that a CLI release adds
 * can be used the day it ships, without anyone typing `claude update`.
 *
 * Tars starts every claude with DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1 (managedCliEnv) and every
 * Amp with `amp.updates.mode: "disabled"`, and Noah runs all his sessions
 * through Tars, so neither CLI ever updated itself. On 2026-09-22 claude 2.1.280
 * had shipped Opus 5.5 and the fleet could not use it until claude was updated
 * by hand.
 *
 * Tars runs the update itself, once, rather than letting each session's own
 * updater do it. Measured with claude 2.1.273 and 2.1.280 in a throwaway HOME:
 *
 * - Claude Code's updater runs inside each session, from its footer, at start
 *   and then every thirty minutes. Three sessions started together made three
 *   separate 217 MB downloads (three staging directories, about 35 s each where
 *   one alone takes 10 s), and each then read "Update installed · Restart to
 *   update" until it was restarted. With twenty agents that is twenty downloads
 *   of every release, and twenty footers asking for a restart.
 * - `claude update` run once beside a live session leaves the session alone. The
 *   native installer writes the new version beside the old one in
 *   ~/.local/share/claude/versions and swaps ~/.local/bin/claude in one step:
 *   polled every millisecond, the link was never missing. The session keeps
 *   running the file it started from, same inode, drew nothing (0 bytes), and
 *   its next turn answered. The first session on a version also holds a lock
 *   on it (~/.local/state/claude/locks/<version>.lock), and the installer's
 *   cleanup, which keeps the two newest versions, skips a locked one: with fake
 *   newer versions pushing it out of those two, the running version survived,
 *   and was deleted by the first cleanup after that session exited, with a
 *   second session still on it. That session's next turn answered all the
 *   same, from the deleted file, but its Grep and Glob tools did not (QA, on
 *   three sessions of 2.1.280): native claude runs its embedded ripgrep by
 *   starting its own file again, as `rg`. With no `rg` on PATH every later
 *   search fails, `posix_spawn 'rg'` ENOENT; with Homebrew's on PATH, as in a
 *   Tars terminal on Noah's machine, the first one fails with a misleading
 *   "ripgrep not found on PATH" and the next ones go through the system `rg`.
 *   USE_BUILTIN_RIPGREP=0, with `rg` on PATH, kept both working: a later
 *   change to managedCliEnv. A new launch, and so a restart, starts on the new
 *   version, and ends it.
 * - Two or three `claude update` at once all succeed and leave one install.
 *   Tars still runs one pass at a time.
 *
 * Amp is a global npm package, and npm replaces a package in place, so an Amp
 * update is only started when no process is running that binary (`lsof`).
 * Measured with @sourcegraph/amp 0.0.1788811227 to 0.0.1790107230: a process
 * that was already running survived and kept answering, but `bin/amp` was
 * missing from the moment npm removed the old package until the new one was
 * in place, 8 to more than 31 s when the download happened inside that window,
 * and 3.3 to 9.3 s when the tarballs were already cached, followed by 0.2 to
 * 0.9 s on a 141-byte placeholder that prints "Amp native binary not
 * installed". Hence the download into a scratch prefix first. A launch that
 * falls in the window still fails: nothing here holds a launch back. npm's
 * cache for all of it lives in that scratch folder and goes with it, since
 * ~/.npm is never pruned and kept 38 MB of every Amp release.
 *
 * `amp update` itself cannot do it for Noah: his Amp is installed as
 * @sourcegraph/amp, renamed since to @ampcode/cli, and `amp update` runs
 * `npm install -g @ampcode/cli`, which fails with EEXIST on the `amp` link the
 * old package owns. Tars updates whichever package owns the binary, by its own
 * name, which is what `amp update` does for an install made under the new one.
 *
 * Covered: claude through its native installer, and Amp as a global npm
 * package. Every other CLI, and those two installed any other way, is left
 * alone and says so in the log: none of codex, gemini, grok, opencode or pi is
 * installed on the machine this was measured on, so no update path for them
 * could be checked, and a guessed one would look covered and do nothing.
 *
 * Only the CLIs at least one agent runs are checked: a fleet with no Amp agent
 * never has Amp updated, and the log says so once. And only while "Check for
 * updates" is on in Settings, the one switch for Tars's own updates and these
 * (Noah, 2026-09-23), read at every pass so turning it off stops the next one.
 *
 * Only an install under the home Tars runs in is touched. That is where
 * `claude update` writes, and it keeps a sandbox or a test run, whose HOME is a
 * scratch folder, away from the real CLIs.
 *
 * Windows lays both paths out otherwise: see cli-updater-windows.ts, which
 * every site below calls on win32 and only there.
