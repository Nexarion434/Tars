/**
 * Which orchestrator a message from the user is for (point E of DESIGN-RELAIS-HERMES-V2.md).
 *
 * The bots gave a free message to the first orchestrator found, all projects considered: on Noah's machine an
 * orchestrator of a project at rest, so his messages never reached the one he was writing to. Now a message names its
 * project with "@project text", the same prefix the relay's plugin reads on Telegram; without one, it goes to the
 * fleet's orchestrator only when there is exactly one. Otherwise nobody gets it, and the sender gets the list.
 *
 * A project's name is its folder's, in any case, written as one word: a space, an @, a colon or a comma in it becomes
 * a dash ("o'neil project" is "@o'neil-project"), the form the relay sends and registers too, since nothing can be
 * written after "@" past a space. Two projects with the same name share it, and a message to that name is answered
 * with the list rather than guessed.
