 *   X-Tars-Caller-Id naming somebody else alongside it is not a mistake any
 *   honest caller makes, since the id and the token come from the same
 *   environment, so the call is refused rather than quietly re-labelled.
 * - The **shared token**, `~/.dorothy/api-token`: authorised, and nobody. No
 *   header is read with it, neither the id nor the project. Every agent can
 *   read that file, so a name that comes with it proves nothing, and believing
 *   the name was how any agent could be any other. Who presents it: a curl run
 *   by hand, and an MCP server whose process was started
 *   without a token of its own. The super chat and Hermes did too, measured
 *   before 1.7.6; each holds a credential of its own now. Not the renderer: it
 *   only ever calls /api/local-file, which is exempt, and presents no token.
 * - **Tars's own pass**, minted in this process's memory and written nowhere:
 *   the caller is the main process itself, which is no agent either but is not
 *   refused where an agent is required. The super chat holds it; nothing else
 *   can, since it never reaches a file or a child's environment.
 * - The **Hermes webhook secret**, `~/.tars-private/hermes-webhook-secret`:
 *   Hermes, on `/api/webhooks/hermes` and nowhere else. It is the only
 *   credential Tars publishes off the machine. Read here, at the door, because
 *   the door used to know only the other secrets, and Hermes presenting the
 *   one Tars minted for it was refused 401 before the route it was aimed at
 *   could run (measured on b17db0f). On any other path it is nothing, and the
 *   401 below.
 * - Anything else: unauthorised, with the same flat message as before, which
 *   tells a prober nothing about which of the two it got wrong.
 *
 * Nobody is not the same as refused, and the difference is per route. The bus
 * refuses a call with no agent behind it before looking at any room, and since
 * this lot the routes that drive an agent do the same: the shared token opens
 * no room and starts, stops, messages and deletes nothing. Nor does it reach
 * the webhook, which is Hermes's alone; it used to, as a fallback, and that
 * was the whole fleet, nor the hook routes, which take an agent's own token.
 * It still reads: the listing and the per-agent reads stay open to it.
