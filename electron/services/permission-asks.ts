/**
 * Permissions decided by Tars (mods step 2, ETUDE-MODS-CLAUDE-CODE.md §2).
 *
 * When Claude Code would put a tool call to its permission dialog, the state
 * mod's `tool.check` hook asks Tars instead (POST /api/hooks/permission), and
 * the request is held here until the window answers (agent:answerPermission):
 * allow or deny is then Claude Code's decision, with no dialog and nothing
 * typed into the terminal. A question handed back (`ask`), one nobody answers
 * within the bound, and one whose session ends go back to the engine, whose
 * own decision then stands: the dialog, as before the mod. Measured on 2.1.289:
 * a hook may await Tars past its 10 s budget, since a `$` call in flight is not
 * counted, and the model reads a deny's reason.
 *
 * Only the window answers. No API route takes an answer: an agent that could
 * answer could allow its own calls, or a teammate's.
