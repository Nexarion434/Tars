/**
 * ask_user: a project's orchestrator asks the user a question on their Telegram, through their Hermes (the relay,
 * DESIGN-RELAIS-HERMES-V2.md), and their answer is typed into that orchestrator's terminal.
 *
 * - Only an orchestrator asks (Noah's rule of 2026-10-01): a worker asks its orchestrator, which decides whether to
 *   ask the user, and passes the answer on.
 * - A question is recorded (id, agent, time, expiry) and sent through the relay as plain text under the agent's and
 *   the project's names, every line of the agent's words quoted, so none can pass for Tars's own, and every secret
 *   masked. Hermes down: it waits, the agent is told it has not gone, and it goes when Hermes takes it.
 * - The user answers with Telegram's "reply" on that very message. The tars-relay plugin keeps it from Hermes's model,
 *   and Tars takes it only as a reply to a message on its own list of what it sent (hermes-relay.ts).
 * - The answer is typed into the asking agent's terminal through the writer every message takes (its dialog guard
 *   included), after a line only Tars writes, "Message from the user via Telegram: " (senderLine): the answer alone,
 *   never the question, named by the time it was asked. Into a CLI only: an agent with no CLI running is not typed
 *   into, and the user is told.
 * - One open question per agent, 20 a day for the whole fleet, and 4 hours to answer: then the agent is told there was
 *   no answer, by the time it asked, never by its words, and a later reply is refused.
 * - Kept in ~/.tars-private (0600), not in ~/.dorothy, which every agent can write: a record rewritten there would
 *   send their answer to another agent.
