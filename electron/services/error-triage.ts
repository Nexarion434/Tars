/**
 * Sentry's errors, reproduced and reported: step 3 of PLAN-RELAIS-SENTRY.md.
 *
 * Nothing outside can reach Tars, which listens on 127.0.0.1 only, so Tars
 * asks. Every 15 minutes, with a read-only token (`sentryAuthToken` in
 * app-settings.json, scope `event:read`), it lists the unresolved issues of the
 * Sentry project its own error reports go to (the DSN's), in the noah-boisserie
 * organisation, EU region. Each issue it has not filed yet becomes a task on
 * the Hermes board of the project named in Settings (`sentryTriageProject`),
 * parked on the Tars lane, where Hermes never runs it, and the user is asked on
 * Telegram, through the relay, for a go-ahead (Noah's decision 4 of 2026-10-01).
 * Nobody else hears of it before the answer. "oui" hands the task on: that
 * project's orchestrator is told, in Tars's words, so that it hands the task to
 * QA or the Audit. They reproduce the error in a sandbox and report: reproduced
 * or not, the cause, the severity, the file and line, the smallest fix. Nothing
 * is fixed in this mode. "non" archives the task. Anything else is asked again.
 *
 * Nothing runs while the token is empty, error reports are off, no project is
 * named, Hermes is not configured (a hermes-connection.json that reads and
 * names an address, #188: without one, the default port is only a guess, and
 * on Noah's machine it is a tunnel to his real Hermes), or the relay is off,
 * with nobody to ask.
 *
 * The go-aheads are kept in ~/.tars-private/sentry-go-aheads.json, which no
 * agent is handed: the user's "oui" hands a task on in their name, and an agent
 * able to write that list could do it in their place. A reply counts only
 * through the relay, which takes it only as an answer to a message on Tars's
 * own list. A note the orchestrator could not get, its CLI not running, is
 * owed there, and goes once the CLI runs, after a restart of Tars too.
 *
 * Once per issue. `~/.dorothy/error-triage.json` (0600) keeps the issues filed
 * and when, and Hermes's idempotency key (`tars-sentry:<issue id>`) hands back
 * the task already on the board when that list is lost, or when Tars stopped
 * between a task and the list. A list that cannot be read stops the triage:
 * read as empty, it would file everything again. At most 10 tasks in any 24
 * hours, the oldest issue first, so an old one never waits behind new ones for
 * ever; the rest wait for room.
 *
 * The error is quoted as data, never as instructions: its words can come from
 * outside Tars (a file name, a page, a message). Each field sits on one line of
 * its own, quoted, with what does not show written out as `[U+202E]` and a cut.
 * The note to the orchestrator carries none of them, since it is typed as
 * Tars's own words: the task ids and Sentry's short ids, both checked.
