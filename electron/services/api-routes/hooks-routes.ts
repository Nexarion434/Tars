 *   is registered WITHOUT changing status. Otherwise its startup "idle" would
 *   resolve the orchestrator's long-poll before the task even begins.
 * - Status posts carrying a session_id that doesn't match the registered
 *   session are stale (hooks of a killed PTY still in flight) and are ignored.
 * - `currentSessionId` is NOT cleared on idle: the one-shot claude process is
 *   still alive at its prompt and its later hooks must keep matching.

/**
 * Is this post coming from a session that no longer owns the agent?
 *
 * Two ways to be stale: the post carries the id of a session that was killed
 * (the tombstone), or it carries an id that simply is not the registered one.
 * A killed PTY's hooks are separate processes that outlive the kill, so both
 * happen routinely rather than only under attack.
 *
 * /output, /status and /task-completed each spelled this out inline; the two
 * routes that fire desktop notifications did not check at all, so a hook from a
 * session the user had already moved on from could still tell them their agent
 * needed permission. That is one of the ways the app appeared to ask twice.

 * no hook checks that jq exists. "" is falsy, so every guard written as
 * `if (!sessionId)` or `sessionId &&` answered "this is not stale" in exactly
 * the case it existed to catch. The measured consequence: the Stop hook of a
 * killed pty posts idle with an empty id, and puts the live session to sleep.
 * Worse, a SessionStart carrying "" was accepted, `currentSessionId` was set
 * to "" and saved to disk, so ownership was erased for good and any session
