 *
 *  Two names on purpose. The MCP client was renamed to send `X-Tars-Caller-*`
 *  while this reader still expected `x-dorothy-caller-project`; the bundles on
 *  disk predate the rename, so it worked by accident and would have broken the
 *  moment anyone rebuilt them - project scoping would have silently switched
 *  off, and every guarded route would 403. Accepting both is what makes the
 *  rename safe in either order. The old name can go once no shipped bundle
 *  sends it.

 *  same reading, and a second copy of a header name is a second thing to
