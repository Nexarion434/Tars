 * What an agent is actually on, as opposed to what Tars last wrote down.
 *
 * `agent.branchName` was only ever set by Tars itself, from the edit screen or
 * the create call, and nothing read it back, so an agent that ran
 * `git checkout -b` kept the old branch on its card. The working tree wins for
 * the branch: it is what actually happened.
 *
 * The model is the other way round, and it used to be the same way. The
 * session's model replaced the record's everywhere, launches included, so the
 * model a session last answered on outlived every choice made after it: moved
 * to Opus 5.5 in the Agents page, thirteen agents relaunched on the model their
 * previous session had used, Opus 5 for most and Opus 4.8 for one. And the edit
 * screen, filled from that list, wrote the old model back into the record on
 * the next save of anything. So the record is the model an agent launches on,
 * and the session's reading travels beside it as `sessionModel`, for a screen
 * that wants to say the session runs something else, after a `/model` typed
 * into it. Both readings are cheap and cached, because the agent list is
 * rebuilt about twice a second.

 * `isAsync`; 322 were followed by a note naming the id with a `<status>`
 * (completed, failed, killed, stopped), 7 were stopped with TaskStop, which
 * sends no note, and the other 3 were still running. A Monitor's event notes
 * carry no status: only a status ends it.
