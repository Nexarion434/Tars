/**
 * Makes an account's configuration folder one Tars's agents can work in
 * (DESIGN-COMPTES-CLAUDE.md, B2). Run when the account is added, before its
 * login terminal, and again at each launch on it, so what it copies stays
 * current.
 *
 * Measured on claude 2.1.283: with CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR set, everything below is
 * read from that folder, symbolic links followed.
 *
 * - Shared through links to ~/.claude: projects/ (the transcripts, and every
 *   agent's memory, which lives in projects/<project>/memory; Usage, the Chat,
 *   resume and the Memory page all read ~/.claude/projects, and `--resume`
 *   from another account finds nothing without it), history.jsonl and
 *   sessions/ (the stats Tars reads, the Audit's N3; measured on 2.1.283, a
 *   prompt is appended through the link and a session's file written and
 *   removed through it, the links staying links), and the user's own
 *   CLAUDE.md, skills, agents, commands, plugins and output styles.
 * - settings.json: a copy of ~/.claude/settings.json, which is the source. It
 *   carries Tars's hooks and status line, so every account reports like
 *   account 1. A copy and not a link: a file Claude Code rewrites by renaming
 *   a new one over it would turn a link into a file of its own, silently.
 *   Without any credential Claude Code would sign in with (see
 *   CREDENTIAL_KEYS): a copied API key would make every account one account,
 *   and copying a credential is exactly what Tars never does.
 * - .claude.json: the account's own (its identity lives there). Mirrored from
 *   ~/.claude.json: the MCP servers, the theme, and the bypass acceptance
 *   (measured: without it, `--dangerously-skip-permissions` stops on a warning
 *   with "No, exit" preselected); and, for the project being launched, its
 *   whole projects[] entry: trust, and the approvals of its .mcp.json servers
 *   and CLAUDE.md imports, which would otherwise ask again in every account.
 *   Onboarding is marked done.
 *
 * The folder must be Tars's own before anything is written (accountDirProblem).
 * One that is not is refused, never repaired. Nothing else in it is opened,
 * listed or read: the credential (the keychain item named after the folder, or
 * .credentials.json on Linux) is Claude Code's alone.
