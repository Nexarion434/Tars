/**
 * Handing something to an agent at a moment when it can take it.
 *
 * This started as one thing: telling an orchestrator that the agent it
 * dispatched had finished. Delegation was one-directional, an orchestrator had
 * to keep asking, and the day nobody armed a loop a whole QA pass finished with
 * nobody the wiser.
 *
 * The bus needs exactly the same machinery for a different payload: a message
 * from one agent to another, or from Noah, that must not land in the middle of
 * a turn. So it is the same queue, not a second one beside it. Per recipient,
 * coalescing, capped, behind the same session barrier and the same write
 * window: two queues that look alike would drift, and this one is the one the
 * tests drive end to end.
 *
 * The transport is the one Tars already uses to wake an agent up:
 * writeProgrammaticInput into its PTY, exactly as /dispatch does. There is no
 * MCP mechanism for this and there cannot be one, because MCP is request and
 * response: a server cannot wake a client that is not asking it anything.

/**
 * What an agent has to say to whoever handed it work. Three kinds, and

 *   permission prompt, or a `waiting` with no reason from a CLI that posts
 *   nothing more precise. Blocked on a question is as much a reason to come
 *   back as finished, and the work is not over, so the link stays.
 * - `ended`: it is back at rest, `idle` or `waiting` because idle, and a turn
 *   has begun since the work was handed to it. That is the work done.
 *
 * A `waiting` because idle is not news of its own. It is Claude Code's idle
 * prompt, a minute after the agent stopped at its prompt, and while `idle` was
 * not news it was the only thing that told an orchestrator a delegated turn
 * had ended: a minute late, and also each time the agent came back to rest for
 * any other reason. Noah's note of 2026-09-18 was one of those. A failed ACP
 * start put 1212-Backend back to the `waiting` it had left, and the
 * orchestrator of a delegation finished 85 minutes earlier was told it "is now
 * waiting". The rest is now news once, as the end of the work handed over,
 * whichever post brings it: the Stop hook's `idle`, or for a turn that ended

 * only a convincing sentence, and look-alike characters get past any list. So
 * the fence is a word drawn for this note alone, from 96 random bits, after the
 * message was written. The note announces it before the message and closes it
 * after, so whatever the message imitates sits visibly inside, and it cannot
