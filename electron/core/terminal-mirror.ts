 * The panels used to be rebuilt from `agent.output`, the last 400 to 600 chunks
 * of the stream. Claude Code in fullscreen paints its frame once and then sends
 * only the cells that change: a spinner tick is a cursor move and one digit.
 * After about three minutes of a turn with no input, the kept chunks held no
 * frame at all, only those changes, and a panel mounted then (back from
 * another page, or from another project's tab) showed the timer and the spinner
 * line on a blank screen. Measured by the Audit on 2026-09-23 in a sandbox with
 * the real Claude Code 2.1.280, four minutes into a turn: 856 visible
 * characters in the panel before leaving the Dashboard, 37 after coming back.
 * Nothing healed it but a change of size, and a panel that comes back at the
 * size it left sends the program no SIGWINCH.
 *
 * So the screen is kept rather than the stream. This is the same emulator as
 * the renderer's, xterm 5.3, with the Dashboard's line handling
 * (`convertEol`), so what it holds is what a panel that never unmounted would
 * show: both screens with the alternate one active or not, the cursor, the
 * modes a replay depends on, and the last MIRROR_SCROLLBACK lines of history.
 * It works for every CLI and sends the program nothing.
 *
 * One per PTY, not per agent. A PTY that replaces another is a new terminal,
 * and what the old one left behind, an alternate screen that was never left or
 * a mouse request that was never withdrawn, is not part of the new one.

 * absolutely at most twice. A terminal on its alternate screen that receives

 * move anywhere in it, so a fullscreen program that climbs with `CSI A` and
