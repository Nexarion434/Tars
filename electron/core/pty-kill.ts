/**
 * Ends a terminal without node-pty's `AttachConsole failed` (audit A22,
 * matrix row 17).
 *
 * node-pty 1.1 ends a ConPTY terminal (WindowsPtyAgent.kill, inbox ConPTY)
 * by forking lib/conpty_console_list_agent.js with the shell's pid, to list
 * the processes on its console and kill them. The helper frees its own
 * console, attaches to the shell's, and throws when the shell has none left:
 * every kill of a terminal whose shell has exited, and any whose shell exits
 * in the time the fork takes to start. Measured on Windows 11 26200 with
 * node-pty 1.1.0 (2026-09-25): 3 kills of 3 exited cmd.exe printed "Error:
 * AttachConsole failed" from the fork, under Node 22 and under Electron 44
 * alike. node-pty then waits five seconds for the list and kills the shell's
 * pid anyway, a pid Windows released when that shell exited and may have
 * handed to another process since. Here the helper's throw reached stderr
 * only; openai/codex#25272 reports it as an error dialog in an Electron app,
 * which is the failure the audit (A22) was reproduced from.
 *
 * So on win32, before kill() asks for that list, the terminal's agent is
 * given a list of its own: none once the shell has exited (there is no
 * console left to attach to, and no pid of its to trust); otherwise the same
 * helper, forked silently, whose failure means the shell has gone and gives
 * an empty list, and whose silence past five seconds gives the shell's pid
 * only while the shell still runs. Everything else kill() does, the pseudo
 * console, the sockets, the output worker, is node-pty's own.
 *
 * This reaches into node-pty's WindowsPtyAgent (`_agent`, its
 * `_getConsoleProcessList`, `_useConpty`, `_useConptyDll`, `_innerPid` and
 * `exitCode`), as installed at 1.1.0, and only a node-pty whose package.json
 * says 1.1.x is touched. Any other version, one whose version cannot be read,
 * any other shape, winpty, and `useConptyDll` (whose kill forks nothing) are
 * left to node-pty. darwin/linux: pty.kill(), and nothing of node-pty is read.

/**
 * The end of a quit that ended terminals (win-qa, 2026-09-27).
 *
 * Killing a ConPTY terminal closes its pseudo console, and its shell exits a
 * moment later: 125 ms idle, seconds on a busy machine. node-pty waits for that
 * exit on a thread of its own, which then calls back into Node, and at quit
 * Node is being torn down by then. Measured with Electron 44 and node-pty 1.1.0,
 * 6 terminals ended at before-quit, electron.exe started directly and idle: the
 * main process outlived its `exit` event until it was killed 15 s later in 7
 * quits of 10, and the 3 others ended in 0xC0000409. In the app, 8 idle quits
 * of 16 ended in 0xC0000409 and Windows Error Reporting, which holds the dying
 * process for as long as it takes to write its report, the profile still open.
 *
 * So once the terminals are ended, the quit is held at will-quit, after the
 * windows are gone and before Node is torn down, until every terminal ended
 * here has reported its exit to the app (node-pty's `exitCode`, set by that
 * very callback), then the app exits. EXIT_WAIT_MS at most: a shell that
 * never reports costs the quit that long, and then the old race, said in the
 * log. Only node-pty 1.1's inbox ConPTY is waited for, the one read here.
 * darwin/linux: nothing is held and nothing of node-pty is read.
