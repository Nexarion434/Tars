/**
 * What Noah has typed into an agent's input field and not sent, as far as Tars
 * can know it from the keys it relays.
 *
 * Every key typed into an agent's terminal passes through the main process
 * (`agent:input`, then `writeToPty`), so the field can be rebuilt from them:
 * this is that rebuild, and nothing else. It never reads the screen. It knows
 * a small set of keys and gives up on everything else: a draft Tars is not
 * sure of is never touched (see `writeProgrammaticInput`), so giving up is the
 * safe answer and guessing is the unsafe one.
 *
 * Every rule below was measured on Claude Code 2.1.273 in a real terminal,
 * `tui: fullscreen` as Noah runs it, keys sent the way xterm sends them, and
 * what each submission carried read from its UserPromptSubmit hook (2026-09-18):
 * - Left and Right move over the whole text, newlines included; Home, End,
 *   Ctrl+A and Ctrl+E stop at the current line; Backspace joins lines.
 * - Ctrl+C empties the field, idle or in the middle of a turn, and does not
 *   interrupt the turn.
 * - Option+Enter (ESC CR) inserts a newline, 9 times out of 9; so does a
 *   backslash before Enter, 9 out of 9, and the backslash goes.
 * - A paste of more than 800 characters, or of four lines or more, shows as
 *   `[Pasted text #N]`, numbered per session: it cannot be put back as it was.
 * - A paste that is nothing but a newline, which is what the panels send for
 *   Shift+Enter, was dropped 9 times out of 12. Whether the newline is in the
 *   field is therefore unknowable.
 * - Up and Down recall history on the first and last line, Tab completes, a
 *   lone Esc arms "Esc again to clear" or, on an empty field, the rewind
 *   dialog: none of them can be followed from the keys alone.
 * - The UserPromptSubmit hook runs 33 to 57 ms after the Enter that submits
 *   (five submissions, median 41), which is what makes it usable as proof
 *   that a field emptied.
