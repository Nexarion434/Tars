 *   "Yes, delete it" to "Delete the build folder?". Enforced by the writer
 *   itself (pty-manager.ts), at the moment it writes.
 * - `no_cli`: no CLI runs in the terminal, which is a shell.
 * - `launch`: a launch is on its way and its session is not up (sessionStarting).
 * - `turn`: a turn runs. A room message and a note wait for its end
