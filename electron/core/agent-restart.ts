/**
 * A changed model or effort applies without anybody relaunching by hand.
 *
 * A CLI reads its model, its effort and its other flags once, when it starts.
 * Saving new ones in the Agents page changed the record and nothing else: the
 * CLI in the terminal went on as it was, until Noah relaunched every session
 * himself. So when a setting the CLI only reads at launch changes, the agent's
 * CLI is restarted on it, through the same launch every window uses
 * (core/agent-launch.ts, which is `agent:start`), continuing its conversation.
 *
 * When, is what this module is about. Never in the middle of something:
 * - a turn in progress (`running`, or waiting on a permission answer) ends
 *   first, and its end is what brings this back here;
 * - a field somebody has typed in and not sent, or typed in during the last
 *   five seconds, or that Tars is typing a message into, or holds messages
 *   for: killing the terminal would throw that away (see fieldInUse);
 * - a note or a room message agent-watch owes the agent: those belong to the
 *   session they were owed to and would be dropped with it;
 * - work the session left running in the background when its turn ended (a
 *   Bash command, a Monitor, an asynchronous Agent): it reports back as a turn
 *   of its own, and killing the CLI kills it (see pendingBackgroundWork).
 * Otherwise at once. An agent with no CLI running has nothing to restart: its
 * next launch reads the new values like any launch does.
 *
 * Only the CLIs on the claude binary. Their turns are known to end (the Stop
 * and StopFailure hooks) and their field is the one the draft model was
 * measured on. Codex, Gemini, Grok, OpenCode, Pi and Amp report neither, so
 * restarting one could cut a turn or a draft nobody can see: they take the new
 * values at their next launch. The thirteen providers that point the claude
 * binary at another vendor are among those restarted, and pick their
 * conversation up the same way (resumeFlags, in providers/cli-provider.ts):
 * until they did, a changed setting silently started them on a new one.
