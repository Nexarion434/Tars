/**
 * Stopping an agent: it is ended, and it says who stopped it, when and why
 * (PLAN-1.9.2.md item A, Noah 28/09).
 *
 * A stop sent the terminal's shell its hangup and marked the agent `idle`.
 * Measured: on 28/09 two frozen CLIs survived stop_agent, reparented to
 * launchd; on 30/09 a stopped QA's bench (gate.sh, then npm exec tsc) survived
 * orphaned and ignored SIGTERM. And `idle` is what an agent never started
 * reads, so the Dashboard resumed a stopped one at the next launch and the
 * kanban handed it work.
 *
 * Now the agent is `stopped`, with `stoppedBy` (an agent's name, "Tars" for its
 * own pass, "you" for the window), `stoppedAt` and `stopReason`, until a new
 * terminal is started for it (clearStop). The state is recorded, saved and
 * announced first, then the terminal's whole tree is ended as the quit ends it
 * (endTerminalTree): its exit, which comes after, finds its pty no longer the
 * agent's and changes nothing.
