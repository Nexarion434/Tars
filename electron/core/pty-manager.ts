 * Text that cannot become control.

 * Everything this module types into an agent's terminal is written by someone

 * task. The terminal reads control characters as keys, so text that carries
 * them stops being text.
 *
 * Two ways in, and the second is why this strips more than the paste marker.
 * A long or multi-line payload is wrapped in `\x1b[200~ … \x1b[201~`, and a
 * payload containing the closing marker ends that paste early: everything
 * after it arrives as ordinary typing, and the carriage return Tars sends 300
 * ms later submits it. A short single-line payload is written with **no
 * markers at all**, so there every control character is typed directly: a bare
 * `\r` submits what came before it and makes the rest a second command, with
 * no escape sequence needed.
 *
 * So: the paste markers go, then every C0 and C1 control except tab and
 * newline, which are content inside a paste. What is left of any other escape
 * sequence is its printable tail, which is inert.
 *
 * A marker has two spellings, and only one of them has a bracket. `\x1b[201~`
 * is the 7-bit form; in the 8-bit form the single byte `\x9b` *is* ESC plus
 * `[`, so the sequence is `\x9b201~` with no bracket to match. A pattern that
 * requires one, `[\x1b\x9b]\[201~`, can therefore never match the 8-bit form:
 * the second pass then eats the `\x9b` and prints the `201~`. Hence the
 * alternation below rather than a character class, and do not fold it back.
 *
 * This lives here rather than in the callers because the callers are the
 * problem: bus, Telegram, Slack and dispatch all pass text they did not write,
 * and a fifth added tomorrow would have to remember. The guarantee belongs on
 * the line that does the writing.

 *   order, which is what `held` below is for.
 * - Too long, and a message waits. Nothing is lost there either, but an

/**
 * Write a message into a terminal, on a line of its own.
 *
 * `bracketPaste` is what tells the two callers apart, and they are genuinely
 * two things. False is a shell command into a shell that is about to be
 * replaced by the CLI it launches; true is a message into a CLI already
 * running, which is every note an agent, a bot, a room or a dispatch sends,
 * and the only one that can land in a field somebody is typing in.
 *
 * So the guard is on the true path, where it was measured. A message is
 * written when the field is free of a human draft, and queued here when it is
 * not: the wait belongs to the line that writes, not to the ten callers, and
 * a caller that returns without having written is exactly how the draft and
 * the message ended up submitted together.
 *
 * The carriage return is ALWAYS a separate, delayed write. Claude Code's TUI
 * treats a rapid "text\r" burst as a single paste event and buffers it
 * without submitting (the text lands in the input box as "[Pasted text]" but
 * is never sent). Delaying the \r lets the paste settle so it registers as a
 * deliberate submit keystroke. Multi-line / long input is additionally
 * wrapped in bracket paste markers so the terminal treats it as one paste
 * rather than line-by-line input.
 *
 * Says which of three things happened, because a caller that answers an HTTP
 * request with "sent" when nothing was written is telling somebody a lie they
 * cannot check: `written` means it is in the terminal, `held` means it is
 * queued behind a human draft and will go in when that field frees, and
 * `refused` means nothing was taken and the caller still owns it.
 *
 * DO NOT use this for raw keystroke passthrough from xterm.js UI terminals:
 * that is `writeHumanInput`, which is also what keeps the field known.
