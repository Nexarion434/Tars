/**
 * Tars's data folder is ~/.tars since 2.0.4 (the maintainer's decision of
 * 18/10), and was ~/.dorothy. It moves once, at the start, before anything
 * reads or writes it: constants/index.ts settles it as it loads, and every
 * path of the app is computed from what it answers.
 *
 * The move is one rename in the home folder, which the system does whole or
 * not at all: stopped at any moment, the data is in one place or the other,
 * never in both, never half. A link is then left at ~/.dorothy (a junction on
 * Windows, which needs no privilege) for what outside Tars still names the
 * old path: a CLI's settings Tars has not rewritten yet, an agent started by
 * an older Tars, a script of the user's. It is for 2.0.4 only; the next
 * version removes it.
 *
 * Nothing here deletes, copies or merges: when the folder cannot be moved
 * (Windows refuses to rename a folder a process holds), Tars goes on from
 * ~/.dorothy for this run and tries again at the next start; when two
 * different folders stand at ~/.tars and ~/.dorothy, the one that holds
 * Tars's records is used, the other left as it is, and the window is told
 * (`notice`). Which folder that is, pickDataDir decides, and every reader
 * outside the app (the hooks, the status line, the MCP servers, worktree.mjs)
 * follows the same rule. This file imports nothing of the app's: it runs
 * before the app's paths exist.
