 * (delegation, /dispatch, /message, /start). They assemble their environments
 * separately and always have, which is how DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER shipped on one

 * change earlier. The pattern is the bug: anything Tars imposes on a CLI it
 * launched cannot live in the callers, because a caller can be added or
 * forgotten.
 *
 * So it lives here instead, applied after the caller's env and after the
 * provider's own deletions, on the one line that actually starts the process.
 * A third spawn site would have to go through this to exist.
 *
 * The claim this comment used to make, that a third spawn site would have to
 * come through here to exist, was wrong twice over. Switching an agent to the
 * local provider recreated its pty with a direct pty.spawn, and creating an
 * agent from the renderer spawned one too. Both predate all of this, both put
 * CLAUDE_AGENT_ID in the environment through getPtyEnvVars, and neither had
 * the API address, so both posted their hooks to whichever Tars owned 31415.
 * Five sites now, all through here. The fifth is the kanban automation in
 * main.ts, creating agents of its own under a comment saying it duplicates the
 * agent:create handler, which it did, defect included. What deliberately does not are the shells that run no
 * agent: the quick terminal, the skill and plugin runners, and the npx
 * installer. They carry no CLAUDE_AGENT_ID, so a hook fired from one of them
 * has no agent to name and is refused. Anything that spawns an agent belongs
 * here.
 *
 * Its own module rather than a function in pty-manager, because five suites
 * stub pty-manager out wholesale to keep node-pty away from them. Putting the
 * spawn in there would have replaced their `pty.spawn` assertions with a stub
 * of the very thing under test, so they would have gone on passing while
 * checking nothing. Here they reach the real one and keep asserting what they
 * always did.

/**
 * Whether a program runs in an agent's PTY rather than the shell Tars types
 * commands into.
 *
 * Read from the terminal itself, not from the agent's status: a CLI outlives
 * the statuses that say it stopped. A turn that fails leaves claude at its
 * prompt, and an agent marked done or idle keeps its session open, so the
 * status said "not running" while a start typed `cd '...' && claude ...` into
 * a live claude.
 *
 * node-pty names the leader of the terminal's foreground process group
 * (tcgetpgrp, then its p_comm). Measured with the real node-pty and Claude Code
 * 2.1.273 in `/bin/bash -l`: `bash` at the prompt; `2.1.273` while claude runs,
 * at its prompt and during a turn, because the native binary is named after its
 * version, which is why this compares against the shell and never against a
 * CLI's name; `bash` again within 300 ms of `/exit`; `sleep` for a plain
 * command, which counts too, since typing into it is just as wrong. Between the
 * fork and the exec of a command, about 200 ms, the new group's leader is still
 * named bash and this reads false.
 *
 * Until the shell holds its terminal, node-pty gives it two other names, and
 * only the process name was compared. First the file it was asked to spawn, as
 * given, `/bin/bash`: node-pty returns it whenever it finds kernel_task leading
 * the foreground. Then `spawn-helper`, node-pty's own program, which opens the
 * terminal and executes the shell. Measured with the real spawnAgentPty and
 * node-pty 1.1.0 under Electron's node, five spawns: `/bin/bash` for 3 to
 * 127 ms, `spawn-helper` for up to 7 ms, then `bash`. agent:get, which then
 * created a terminal and read this at once, said a CLI ran in a shell that
 * had not started. After a command exits the name is briefly undefined, until the
 * shell takes the terminal back.
 *
 * All of that is the interactive shell. A shell handed its command with `-c`,
 * which is how spawnAgentSession starts every API-driven session, has no job
 * control: the CLI stayed in the shell's process group and node-pty named
 * `bash` for its whole life. Measured on 2026-09-23 by the Audit and the
 * Frontend: every agent the API had started read false with claude alive, the
 * orchestrator among them, so /dispatch and /start ended their sessions and a
 * start from the Dashboard typed its launch line into claude's field.
 * spawnAgentSession now execs the CLI, which names it; but from the spawn to
 * the exec, while the shell reads its login files, the leader is still bash.
 * Such a terminal exists for that one CLI: it never shows a prompt, what is
 * typed into it waits for the CLI (a non-interactive shell does not read its
 * terminal), and it closes when the CLI ends. So it counts for as long as it
 * can be read, starting and then running, and an interactive shell never does
 * at its prompt, where a typed line would run as a command.
