/**
 * Who asked a worker for each piece of work, one request at a time, in order
 * (ORCHESTRATOR-PER-CHAT.md v2.2, PR A; the Audit's R1 to R4).
 *
 * `requestedBy` was one field per worker, written when a message was sent: a
 * second request sent while the worker was still busy overwrote the first,
 * and the first's result went to the second's sender (the bot and an
 * orchestrator, or two agents, handing work to one worker). A request is now
 * queued on the worker when it is sent, and `requestedBy` is only ever the
 * request whose work the worker is doing:
 *
 * - **delivered**: Tars wrote it into the worker's terminal (typed at rest, a
 *   new session's prompt, a held message released, the bus at turn end). It
 *   takes the link when no other holds it;
 * - **bound by its turn**: the turn whose prompt carries its id, which the
 *   sender line Tars types names (`, task t-xxxxxxxx`), takes the link, even
 *   over another delivered one: Claude Code queues what is typed during a
 *   turn, and runs it in its own turns, in order. A turn with no id (Noah
 *   typing, a scheduled task, a /loop) takes nothing;
 * - **spent**: its work ended and its requester was told (agent-watch). The
 *   next delivered request takes the link: a CLI with no prompt hook still
 *   reports each result to its own asker, in order.
 *
 * Plain records on the worker's AgentStatus, saved with agents.json by the
 * callers: a request still out when Tars stopped is found at the next launch.
