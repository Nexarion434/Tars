/**
 * Writing a file that holds credentials.
 *
 * `fs.writeFileSync(p, data)` creates the file with 0666 & ~umask, which on a
 * default umask of 022 lands at 0644 - readable by every other account on the
 * machine. `api-token` and `hermes-webhook-secret` were hardened for this
 * reason; `app-settings.json` was not, and it holds far more: the Telegram,
 * Slack, Discord, Jira, SocialData, X, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Mimo, Moonshot, Qwen,
 * Zhipu, MiniMax, NVIDIA and Nous Portal keys, the Hermes gateway token, and
 * the gbrain and Honcho credentials. One file, twenty-odd secrets, world
 * readable.
 *
 * `mode` on writeFileSync only applies when the file is CREATED, so an
 * existing 0644 file keeps its mode forever. The explicit chmod is what fixes
 * installs that already have one.
 *
 * The write is atomic as well: a crash between truncate and write used to
 * leave an empty settings file, and the app would silently fall back to
 * defaults - every key gone.
 *
 * A directory this has to create is made 0700, readable by its owner alone.
 * It is how `~/.tars-private` comes into being on an install that never had
 * anything to migrate there: made with the default mode, it was 0755, open to
 * a listing by every account on the machine, while the migration, the only
 * other place that made it, made it 0700. A directory that already exists is
 * left as it is: `~/.dorothy` is the agents' directory, and not this
 * function's to narrow.

/**
 * An ordinary state file, written atomically.
 *
 * Same temp-file-then-rename as above, without narrowing the mode: the caller's
 * data is not a credential, but a crash between truncate and write would still
 * leave a half-file that the next parse rejects. agents.json already had this
 * treatment; projects.json did not, and losing it silently empties the user's
 * project list.
 *
 * The temp name is fixed, so it is created, never opened. Whatever holds that
 * name is removed first, which takes a link away without touching what it
 * points at, and the file is then made with 'wx', O_CREAT with O_EXCL, which
 * fails rather than follow anything put there in between, a symbolic link or a
 * hard one. Opened the ordinary way, a symbolic link planted at the temp name
 * sent the contents into the file it named, and a hard link truncated that
 * file in place; the rename then made the link the secret file itself. Found
 * by the audit of lot 4. A leftover temp file from a write that died goes the
 * same way; it used to be written over.
 *
 * On Windows the rename fails while another program holds the file open, even
 * to read it; it is retried for about a second (platform/rename-replacing.ts).

 * not valid JSON`, which is a cookie name in a log that is not 0600 while the
 * file is. The fragment is ten characters and usually harmless, but the rule
 * that no secret reaches a log is only worth having if it holds when the leak
 * is small.
 *
 * redactSecrets is the wrong tool: it matches secret SHAPES (sk-ant-, bearer,
 * NAME=value), and an arbitrary ten-character slice of a file matches none of
 * them, so it would pass `es_session` through and look like it had worked.
 *
 * What a reader needs is why the file was unusable, not what was in it: the
 * parser rejected it, or the filesystem did and here is its code.
