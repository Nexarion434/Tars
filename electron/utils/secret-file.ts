/**
 * Writing a file that holds credentials.
 *
 * `fs.writeFileSync(p, data)` creates the file with 0666 & ~umask, which on a
 * default umask of 022 lands at 0644 - readable by every other account on the
 * machine. `api-token` and `hermes-webhook-secret` were hardened for this
 * reason; `app-settings.json` was not, and it holds far more: the Telegram,
 * Slack, Discord, Jira, SocialData, X, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Mimo, Moonshot, Qwen,
 * Zhipu, MiniMax, NVIDIA and Nous Portal keys, the Hermes gateway token, and
 * the gbrain and Honcho credentials. One file, twenty-odd secrets, world
 * readable.
 *
 * `mode` on writeFileSync only applies when the file is CREATED, so an
 * existing 0644 file keeps its mode forever. The explicit chmod is what fixes
 * installs that already have one.
 *
 * The write is atomic as well: a crash between truncate and write used to
 * leave an empty settings file, and the app would silently fall back to
 * defaults - every key gone.
 *
 * A directory this has to create is made 0700, readable by its owner alone.
 * It is how `~/.tars-private` comes into being on an install that never had
 * anything to migrate there: made with the default mode, it was 0755, open to
 * a listing by every account on the machine, while the migration, the only
 * other place that made it, made it 0700. A directory that already exists is
 * left as it is: `~/.dorothy` is the agents' directory, and not this
 * function's to narrow.
 *
 * On Windows the modes do nothing, and an access list only binds the handles
 * opened after it is set: one opened before keeps what it was granted, and
 * Node opens with full sharing. So a file the startup pass names
 * (closeSecretsToOtherAccounts) is born closed: its temp is created in a
 * staging directory of the account alone (~/.tars-private/.staging), holding
 * that directory's list before its first byte, then renamed into place, which
 * keeps the list (same volume). A file in the private directory is closed by
 * the directory's own list once that pass has closed it, and starts nothing.
 * Until a staging directory is closed (or when it cannot be), the temp is made
 * beside the target and closed before the rename, as before, and that is
 * logged. Any other file (hermes-session.json, rewritten on every gateway
 * reply that sets a cookie) keeps what its folder hands down: one icacls is a
 * process start on the main process, 25 ms on an idle machine and 400 ms on a
 * busy one. A failure is logged and the write goes on. darwin/linux: nothing
 * runs.
