 * Whether an agent's last session can actually be resumed.
 *
 * `claude --resume <id>` reads the conversation back from
 * `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-path>/<id>.jsonl`. If that file is not there,
 * the binary exits with an error instead of starting, so an agent whose
 * transcript has been cleaned up would simply stop launching. Restarting into
 * a fresh conversation is a worse outcome than resuming and a much better one
 * than not starting at all, so the id is only ever used once the file backing
 * it has been found.
 *
 * The project directory name is Claude Code's own encoding: every character
 * of the path that is not a letter or a digit becomes `-` (platform/
 * claude-project-dir.ts; decode-project-path.ts reverses it). On macOS that is
 * mostly `/` and `.`, the rule this file used to apply, which named no folder
 * Claude writes on Windows (`C:\Users\x` stayed `C:\Users\x`). Encoding is
 * lossy, so several paths can encode to the same directory name; that is fine
 * here, because the session id is a UUID and the check is only asking whether
 * this exact transcript exists.
