 * The shell-form command a CLI runs for a Node hook: `node "<script>" <args>`.

 * JSON as a program. Shell form runs everywhere, and it is read by two
 * shells: Git Bash (Claude Code on Windows when Git is installed) and Windows
 * PowerShell (Claude Code without Git Bash, and Gemini CLI always, through
 * `powershell.exe -NoProfile -Command`). So:
 *  - forward slashes: bash would eat the backslashes of an unquoted path, and
 *    turns `\\server` into `\server` even inside double quotes; Node takes
 *    `C:/...` and `//server/share/...` as they are;
 *  - double quotes, which both shells read the same way unless the path holds
 *    `$` or a backtick (expanded by both, escaped differently by each) or a
 *    typographic double quote, U+201C to U+201E, where PowerShell ends a
 *    double-quoted string as it does at `"`; then single quotes, which both
 *    read literally unless the path holds a `'` or a typographic single quote,
 *    U+2018 to U+201B, which PowerShell takes for one;
 *  - a path that neither form carries is refused, loudly, rather than wired
 *    to fail.
 * The arguments are Tars's own event names, never user input.
