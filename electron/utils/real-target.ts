/**
 * Where a read or a write of a path really lands, and whether that is under a
 * root that is not the home nor above it.
 *
 * The file handlers (fs:read-text-file, fs:write-text-file,
 * fs:read-project-files, local-file://, /api/local-file) judged the path as
 * spelled, then readFileSync / writeFileSync / a read stream followed every
 * link on the way. ~/.dorothy is one of their roots and every agent is handed
 * it: one symlink in it to the home opened ~/.ssh and ~/.tars-private, to read
 * and to write, and a symlink in a cloned repository did the same through its
 * project. So the target is followed as the call will follow it, and its real
 * location must lie under the real location of a root, on top of the spelled
 * check.
 *
 * A target that does not exist yet (a write that creates it) is judged by its
 * nearest existing folder, the one the file will be created in. A link to
 * nothing, in its place or on the way, is refused: realpath cannot follow it,
 * and a write would, creating the file wherever it points. A loop of links is
 * refused the same way.
 *
 * "Under" is by identity (device and inode, as BigInt) or by the spelling of
 * both real paths, so a root that is itself a link, a case variant or the
 * Data volume's firmlink compares as the folder it names.
 *
 * Only the roots the target or its real path is under by spelling are looked
 * at on the disk, as isUnderSafeRoot does.
 *
 * One exception, asked for by name (`linkedMarkdown`), and only by the
 * renderer's reads and writes of instruction files (fs:read-text-file,
 * fs:write-text-file, fs:read-project-files: the Brain page). /api/local-file,
 * which takes no token, and local-file:// stay strict: there it would serve
 * any note in the home through a link planted under ~/.dorothy. The exception
 * is for `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, or a project's CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md, linked
 * to a file in a dotfiles repository outside every root, which many Claude
 * Code users keep. The target's last name may be a FILE link out of every root
 * when everything above it really lies in a root (a folder link on the way is
 * the escape itself: ~/.dorothy/h linked to the home) and the file it finally
 * leads to passes linkedFileAllowed.
 *
 * What remains: the check and the read or write that follows are two calls,
 * so a link swapped in between is followed. Whoever can swap it runs as the
 * same user and can open the file directly (SECURITY.md §1). A hard link has
 * no path back to the file it names and passes (SECURITY.md §5); the one
 * caller that takes no token, /api/local-file, refuses a file with more than
 * one name.
