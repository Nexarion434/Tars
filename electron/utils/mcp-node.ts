/**
 * The program Tars's own MCP servers run on: the Node inside the app.
 *
 * Every registration used to name `node`, and the CLI that starts a server
 * looks that up on its own PATH. An agent's terminal is `/bin/bash -l`, and on
 * macOS /etc/profile runs path_helper, which puts /etc/paths, /usr/local/bin
 * first, ahead of the PATH Tars hands the shell. Measured on 2026-09-24: the
 * live Tars's servers ran /usr/local/bin/node, Node 18.16, end of life, though
 * the settings named a Node 22 and nvm had 22 and 24. And a machine with no
 * Node at all, which claude's native installer does not need, got no Tars tools.
 *
 * The app's binary is a Node when ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1 is set, the version
 * Tars ships and runs its own main process on; the seven bundles answered
 * `tools/list` on it in the installed Tars 1.8 (Electron 43, Node 24.18). A
 * checked minimum among the machine's Nodes was the other way: it still leaves
 * a machine with none, or only an old one, without the tools.
 *
 * The CLIs take a command and arguments and no environment of Tars's choosing
 * (and the same files are read by the user's own sessions), so the variable is
 * set by a launcher, ~/.dorothy/bin/tars-mcp-node, which names the app binary.
 * Rewritten when the app has moved (an AppImage mounts somewhere new at each
 * launch), left alone otherwise. This relies on Electron's RunAsNode fuse,
 * which is on by default and which Tars does not turn off; turning it off
 * means giving these servers another runtime first.
 *
 * Windows has no such script to run: `node` there, as before. So is a launcher
 * that cannot be written.
 *
 * Written by a packaged Tars at a lasting place only (the Audit's gate of
 * #201). A dev run on the real HOME rewrote it to a worktree's Electron, and
 * once that was gone every Tars server of every claude session, in Tars and
 * out of it, failed to connect; a copy run from a DMG, or translocated by
 * macOS, is gone once it quits. Such a start names the launcher already there
 * and leaves it as it is, or names `node` when there is none. On Linux the
 * AppImage file ($APPIMAGE) is named, not its mount point under /tmp. And the
 * script itself falls back to the `node` on the PATH when the app it names is
 * gone. A symlinked ~/.dorothy/bin, or a symlinked launcher, is not written
 * through.
