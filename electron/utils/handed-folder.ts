 * Why a folder may not be handed to an agent besides its project (claude's and
 * codex's --add-dir, gemini's --include-directories), or null when it may.
 *
 * Never ~/.tars-private: nothing under it is ever passed to a CLI (CLAUDE.md),
 * and create_agent and update_agent took any folder that existed (the Audit's
 * L1 on #480). Refused: that folder, a folder inside it, and a folder that holds
 * it (the home folder, its parents, the root), by the spelling given and by
 * where its links lead: a folder not made yet is read where its nearest made
 * parent really is, so a link, a junction or a Windows 8.3 short name on its way
 * is followed too.
 *
 * The paths are compared by the rules of the `path` that resolved them, Windows
 * for path.win32 (separators, case, trailing dots and spaces, `\\?\`), never by
 * process.platform alone: a Windows host whose process.platform said linux read
 * a C:\ path by POSIX rules, and a folder inside the private one was not inside
 * it (update-agent-route.test.ts 12b on a Windows PC, 2026-10-20).
