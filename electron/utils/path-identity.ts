/**
 * Whether `candidate` is `dir`, or lies inside it, however either is spelled.
 *
 * A path is a name, and a file has several. On the case-insensitive volume
 * macOS ships, `~/.TARS-PRIVATE/x` opens `~/.tars-private/x`; the Data
 * volume's firmlink puts `/System/Volumes/Data` in front of every path under
 * /Users and /private; a symlink puts a directory anywhere. A prefix test on
 * the string sees none of them: the vault's attach route copied the webhook
 * secret in through the first two (the audit's lead #21, reproduced in a
 * sandbox app). So the question is asked of the file system instead: the
 * candidate's real path, then each directory above it, compared with `dir` by
 * device and inode.
 *
 * `dir` may name a file too (`~/.netrc`): the candidate itself is compared
 * first. A candidate that does not exist is inside nothing, and nothing is
 * inside a `dir` that does not exist; callers keep their lexical test for
 * those.
 *
 * Identities are read as BigInt. A plain stat gives the inode as a Number,
 * exact only below 2^53, and an NTFS file id is 64 bits whose top 16 grow
 * each time a record is reused: two files a record apart then read as one
 * number, and this took an ordinary folder for a blocked one (CI run
 * 36260463284) or a folder outside the home for the home.

/**
 * Whether `candidate` is another name for a file inside `dir`: a hard link.
 *
 * isWithinDir follows a path, and a hard link has none back to the file it
 * names: it is a second directory entry for the same inode, anywhere on the
 * volume, so a link made in /tmp to the webhook secret is inside nothing and
 * the vault copied it in (the audit's gate of #137, measured). Only a regular
 * file with more than one name can be one, so only those are looked for, by
 * device and inode, among the regular files under `dir`, whose symlinks are
 * not followed. `dir` is walked, so this is for small directories whose files
 * are secrets whole: the private directory and ~/.ssh. Read as BigInt, as
 * isWithinDir says why.
