# There is deliberately no "is the API up?" probe here, and adding one back
# would reopen the bug this hook was fixed for. Do not.
#
# It used to ask /api/health first and exit early if that call did not come
# back. Whatever deadline the probe is given, the failure is categorical rather
# than proportional: one millisecond over and the registration POST below is not
# sent at all, so the session starts UNREGISTERED, the ownership contract in
# hooks-routes.ts then drops every status, output and task-completed post it
# makes, and the never-started watch accuses it ten minutes later while it is
# working. Measured against an API that was alive but answering in 3s: probe at
# --max-time 2 registered nothing, and the server saw only the probe.
#
# The POST is the better probe, because it answers "is the API there?" by doing
# the work instead of asking about it, and the answer lands server-side the
# moment the request is received. curl giving up on the *response* does not undo
# the registration: with the probe gone, an API answering in 8s still had the
# POST in hand at 46ms and registered. A probe can only subtract.
#
# The API being down costs nothing either: the connection is refused at once,
# and the retry's sleep makes that path about 1.1s.

# Register this session as the agent's owner. The server recognizes the
# `source` field (only SessionStart sends it) and records session_id WITHOUT
# touching status — the status lifecycle belongs to UserPromptSubmit/Stop.
# Retry once: if registration is lost, the stale-session guard would ignore
# every later status post from this session.
