# API endpoint
# The Tars that spawned this agent, not whoever happens to own 31415:
# CLAUDE_MGR_API_URL is in the pty environment and follows DOROTHY_API_PORT.

# Get agent ID from environment or use session ID
AGENT_ID="${CLAUDE_AGENT_ID:-$SESSION_ID}"

# Update agent status to "running" and set current task to the user's prompt.
#
# Retried once, the same way SessionStart is, and for a heavier reason than
# a status update.
#
# When Tars reuses a live session (a task sent from Slack or Telegram into an
# already running claude), it clears the agent's session ownership as it arms
# the never-started-a-turn check, because that check reads "no session has
# registered yet". That live session will never send a second SessionStart, so
# the only thing that restores ownership is this post: the server adopts the
# first session that reports in without a `source`. Lost, and the agent is
# both unowned and, ten minutes later, accused of never having started while
# it is working. One attempt at best was too thin a thread for that.
#
# See armTaskStartWatch in electron/core/agent-manager.ts and the registration
# fallback in electron/services/api-routes/hooks-routes.ts: this hook is the
# third piece of that mechanism, and it is the only one written in shell.
# `event` names what happened: the server cannot tell a turn starting from any
# other "running" post, and a dispatch has already set that status at spawn.
