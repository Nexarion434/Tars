# StopFailure hook for tars
#
# A turn that ends on an API error does not fire Stop. It fires StopFailure, and
# nothing listened to it, so an agent whose turn failed stayed `running` for
# ever: its process alive, its session registered, a turn begun, every signal
# Tars reads saying it was working.
#
# Measured on claude 2.1.268 with a HOME holding no credential. The CLI does not
# exit. SessionStart fires, the task becomes a turn and UserPromptSubmit fires,
# then the turn ends at once on "Not logged in · Please run /login", and the
# next event is this one:
#
#   {"hook_event_name":"StopFailure","error":"authentication_failed",
#    "last_assistant_message":"Not logged in · Please run /login", ...}
#
# One expired credential is shared by every agent on the machine, so they all
# fail in the same second. That is the night of 2026-09-16: five sessions dead
# in one minute, and Noah asking why nobody was working while the CLI had
# written the reason in each terminal.
#
# So this posts the failure with the CLI's own words, and the server puts the
# agent in `error` carrying them. Not a timer and not a guess about silence:
# the CLI says the turn failed, and says why.
