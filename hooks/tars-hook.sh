# names the agent it is from, and the token proves it. Printed into a header
# through a process substitution, so it never appears in curl's argv.
#
# Sent only to the Tars that spawned the CLI (the Audit's table, #11). While
# Tars is down any process of any account may hold its port, and got every
# token posted to it. So the port is asked first to prove it knows this
# CLI's TARS_INSTANCE_ID: a fresh random challenge goes to /api/health, and
# the answer must be sha256("<id>:<challenge>"). The id itself never leaves.
# No id, no answer within 5 s, or a wrong one: no token, and the post is
# refused as if it had none. 5 s, longer than any post waits (3 s): a Tars
# whose main thread is held (a transcript scan, 2.7 s; the Usage page, 4.15 s)
# still gets its token. At 2 s it did not, and a Stop was lost (the Audit's
# gate of #212). A closed port answers at once; only a squatter that holds
# the connection costs each hook those 5 s. Asked once, here, as the hook starts: tars_auth
# runs in a subshell of its own for each post, where nothing it learnt would
# be kept.
