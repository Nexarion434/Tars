/**
 * The time a chat's page writes beside a name, in its head and over each
 * speaker's lines (src/components/NewShell/chat-bits.tsx, clockOf). Written
 * before the fix. How it can fail:
 * 1. an hour before ten written with one digit ("3:06"), where the
 *    permission ask under the same head writes "03:06", and every other time
 *    in the app has two digits;
 * 2. minutes before ten written with one digit ("10:5");
 * 3. a date that does not parse, or none, shown as "NaN:NaN" or as a time.
