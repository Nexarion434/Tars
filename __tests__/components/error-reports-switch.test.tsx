/**
 * Settings > Preferences, "Send error reports": step 1 of the Sentry plan Noah
 * approved on 2026-09-24 (public, opt-in). The contract with the main process
 * is one AppSettings key, `errorReportsEnabled`, false by default, saved through
 * the settings flow like every other switch; main follows it live. Frames:
 * `Settings · Preferences` and its light copy, in design/tars-redesign.pen.
 * Written before the row, as the ways it can fail:
 * 1. the switch reads on while nothing is sent, or off while reports go out:
 *    it must show `errorReportsEnabled` itself, and off when the key is
 *    missing, as it is in every settings file written before it. The reading
 *    the rows above it use for their default-on keys (`!== false`) shows it on;
 * 2. the page's own defaults, which it shows until main's settings arrive,
 *    have it on;
 * 3. flipping it saves something other than that one key with its new value:
 *    the whole snapshot, which overwrites what other paths changed since, or
 *    the value it already had;
 * 4. the row does not say what a report holds and what it never holds, or has
 *    no way to the privacy policy, or a link that would open in Tars's own
 *    window rather than in the browser; or it promises what is not true: the
 *    Audit's gate found it said a report never holds files or paths, when #221
 *    sends a path under home as ~/... and one outside it whole;
 * 5. the switch has no name of its own for assistive technology.
