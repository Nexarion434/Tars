/**
 * Settings > Preferences on a Windows build offers no "Send error reports"
 * row (D16, Nicolas, 2026-09-28): the reports would go to a Sentry project
 * that has not agreed to receive the port's, and main never starts them there
 * (error-report-windows-off.test.ts). A row hidden, nothing drawn in its place.
 *
 * How it fails:
 * 1. The row is shown on win32, with the setting on or off.
 * 2. Over-correction: a Mac or Linux window no longer shows it
 *    (error-reports-switch.test.ts holds the row itself).
