/**
 * The Disk line of Settings, System: the free space the main process reports,
 * in the waiting ink when the disk is under the floor Tars warns at, as the
 * frame `Settings · System · folders no agent owns` draws it. Only the low flag
 * behind it was tested (__tests__/lib/orphan-folders.test.ts): nothing read the
 * ink the line is drawn in (the Audit's Info at the gate of #341, 2026-10-07).
 *
 * How it fails:
 * 1. A disk under the floor reads its free space in the muted ink: the one
 *    warning the line gives is gone, and the line reads like any other.
 * 2. A disk at the floor or over it reads in the waiting ink: a warning for
 *    nothing, on every machine with room to spare.
 * 3. The line names another figure than the free space that was reported.
