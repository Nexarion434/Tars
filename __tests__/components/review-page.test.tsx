/**
 * The Review page's own side of JeanBrasse's "the Review page only half works"
 * (01/10), from the Audit's DIAG-REVIEW.md. Frames: Review · dark, Review ·
 * light and Review · states, in design/tars-redesign.pen. The pure parts, the
 * list and the cut, are pinned in __tests__/lib/review.test.ts. Written before
 * the code, as the ways it can fail:
 * 1. a project added in Tars that no agent works in is missing from the
 *    list; or it is listed while an agent works in it, or listed without
 *    saying no agent; or a folder Claude Code merely ran in floods the list;
 * 2. a file whose patch main could not read says there is no textual change,
 *    or nothing, and never why;
 * 3. a picked file's patch past 4000 lines is cut without a word, or a patch
 *    that fits says it was cut, or the count is wrong;
 * 4. the answer for a tree no longer selected replaces the selected tree's
 *    files, and a file's patch that comes back after another file was picked
 *    replaces that file's;
 * 5. Refresh reads the selected tree again but not the list: a project or an
 *    agent added since never shows;
 * 6. the page asks review:diff for every patch of the tree, up to 2 MB over
 *    IPC, where it shows a file's patch only once that file is picked (#247's
 *    listOnly); or, with no file picked, it shows a patch at all, where the
 *    panel asks for a file (frame Review · states).
 * Since 2.0.4 (#472) the list is main's scan of every project's repositories
 * (review:repositories), drawn by the column of components/Review, which these
 * cases read and pick through its props; what it draws of them is driven in
 * e2e/review-repositories-window.spec.ts and e2e/review-page.spec.ts.
