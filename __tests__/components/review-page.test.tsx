/**
 * The Review page's own side of Noah's "the Review page only half works"
 * (01/10), from the Audit's DIAG-REVIEW.md. Frames: Review · dark, Review ·
 * light and Review · states, in design/tars-redesign.pen. The pure parts, the
 * list and the cut, are pinned in __tests__/lib/review.test.ts. Written before
 * the code, as the ways it can fail:
 * 1. a project added in Tars that no agent works in is missing from the
 *    list; or it is listed while an agent works in it, or listed without
 *    saying no agent; or a folder Claude Code merely ran in floods the list;
 * 2. a file whose patch main could not read says there is no textual change,
 *    or nothing, and never why;
 * 3. a patch past 4000 lines is cut without a word, or a patch that fits
 *    says it was cut, or the count is wrong, or the hint to pick a file shows
 *    while one is picked;
 * 4. the answer for a tree no longer selected replaces the selected tree's
 *    files, and a file's patch that comes back after another file was picked
 *    replaces that file's;
 * 5. Refresh reads the selected tree again but not the list: a project or an
 *    agent added since never shows.
