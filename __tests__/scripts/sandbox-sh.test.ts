/**
 * scripts/sandbox.sh starts the test build beside the real Tars (the plan's
 * point 13, 19/10: a test copy must never pass for the maintainer's Tars; on
 * 18/10 two Uncaught Exception boxes from the QA's copy looked like his Tars
 * looping). `npm run electron:pack` builds it as "Tars Sandbox"
 * (e2e/sandbox-build.packed.spec.ts reads and launches that build).
 *
 * How it fails, written before the code:
 *  S1. With no app named, it looks for release/mac-arm64/Tars.app, the release's
 *      name, which `electron:pack` no longer builds: it starts a release copy
 *      left there, or says to build an app it then does not find.
 *  S2. It touches the sandbox's HOME before it found an app to start.
