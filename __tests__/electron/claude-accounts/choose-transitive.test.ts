/**
 * QA, gate of #267: "the most room" with three accounts or more.
 *
 * The sort compares accounts in pairs, and two accounts within TIE_POINTS
 * (5) of each other are ordered by the list instead of by room. That rule is
 * not transitive: with margins 2, 6 and 10, 2 ties with 6 and 6 ties with 10,
 * while 10 beats 2 by 8 points. The sort never compares the first account with
 * the last, and the account with 2 points of room was chosen over the one
 * with 10, whichever way the list was ordered.
 *
 * What must hold: the accounts within TIE_POINTS of the BEST margin are the
 * ones the tie rule may reorder; an account more than TIE_POINTS below the
 * best is never chosen while one with room has the best margin.
