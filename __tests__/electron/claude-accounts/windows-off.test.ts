/**
 * D17 (Nicolas, 2026-10-02): several Claude accounts are off on a Windows
 * build until they are ported (their folders' owner-only checks are POSIX
 * modes, their sign-in starts claude by its bare name, and the Node status
 * line keeps no counters per account). Settings hides the section there
 * (claude-accounts-offered.test.ts); this is main's half, the one that starts
 * agents on an account.
 *
 * How it fails, written before the code:
 * 1. On win32 a registry that says on (copied from a Mac, edited by hand, or
 *    written through the IPC) turns the option on: agents would start with the
 *    CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR of a folder Windows never provisioned or protected.
 * 2. Over-correction: on darwin or linux the option no longer reads as on.
 * 3. The accounts themselves are lost on win32, so a later port, or the same
 *    file back on a Mac, finds account 1 alone.
