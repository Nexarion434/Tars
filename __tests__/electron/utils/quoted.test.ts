/**
 * quoted(): a value named in a refusal or a log line, written out so that what
 * does not show cannot act on the text around it.
 *
 * A string went through reveal(); anything else through JSON.stringify, which
 * escapes the C0 controls and nothing more. A direction override, an invisible
 * format character, a C1 control or a line separator inside an object or an
 * array reached the refusal and the log line as it was: the skill that is not a
 * skill name (skill-name.ts), and the skills a saved agent drops as the fleet is
 * read (agent-manager.ts, in agent-persistence.test.ts).
 *
 * How it can fail, written before the code:
 * 1. a format character (U+202E, the isolates U+2066 to U+2069, a zero width)
 *    inside an object or an array is left raw;
 * 2. a C1 control (U+009B, which a terminal reads as ESC and a bracket) or a
 *    line separator (U+2028) inside one is left raw, or a value JSON cannot
 *    write (a symbol) keeps a newline of its own;
 * 3. the refusal of a skill that is an object carries it raw;
 * 4. a string, a number or null is written otherwise than before, or a long
 *    value that is not a string is no longer cut.
