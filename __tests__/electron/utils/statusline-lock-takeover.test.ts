/**
 * Taking over the token-stats lock a dead render left, and releasing one's
 * own, with several renders at once.
 *
 * A render that finds the lock held waits a second, and if the lock is then
 * over 5 s old, it takes the holder for dead and takes the lock over. That
 * takeover was `rmdir` then `mkdir`. Two renders that had judged the same dead
 * lock stale could both pass there: the second removed the lock the first had
 * just taken, and both wrote the count at once (the Audit's review of #216). A
 * render also released its lock by removing whatever lock was there. So a
 * render slow past 5 s, whose lock had been taken over, removed the new
 * holder's (QA's gate of #216).
 *
 * How it fails, written before the code:
 * 1. a render that judged a dead lock stale removes it after another render has
 *    taken it over, and writes beside that render;
 * 2. a render's release removes a lock that is no longer its own;
 * 3. a lock 5 s old is taken for dead. QA's surviving mutant of #216 set the
 *    threshold to 1 s and no test saw it;
 * 4. a lock 6 s old, left by a render killed while it held it, is never taken
 *    over, and every render after it skips its write;
 * 5. a render killed while taking a dead lock over leaves something behind that
 *    stops every later takeover;
 * 6. two renders are inside the takeover of the same dead lock at once, so the
 *    one that comes second removes the lock the first has just taken.
 *
 * As in statusline-lock.test.ts, the installed script runs through bash and jq
 * in a temp HOME, with stand-ins on the PATH that act at the one moment that
 * matters:
 * - `date`, asked for the entry's date while the lock is held, holds a render
 *   there until told to go. Asked for the time, it can give a frozen one, so
 *   that an age is exact however loaded the machine is;
 * - `stat`, asked for the lock's age, lets another render take the lock over
 *   before handing back the age it read.
 * A dead holder is a render killed with SIGKILL while it holds the lock, so the
 * lock is left exactly as the script leaves it.
