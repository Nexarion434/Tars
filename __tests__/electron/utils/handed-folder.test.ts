/**
 * The folder an agent is handed besides its project (claude's and codex's --add-dir, gemini's
 * --include-directories), as create_agent and update_agent take it: never ~/.tars-private, what agents are never
 * handed (CLAUDE.md, "nothing under ~/.tars-private is ever passed to a CLI"). The Audit's L1 on #480.
 *
 * How it fails, written before the code:
 * 1. ~/.tars-private itself is taken.
 * 2. A folder inside it is taken.
 * 3. A folder that holds it is taken: the home folder, a parent of it, the root.
 * 4. Another spelling of one of those is taken: a trailing separator, a `..`, a `.`.
 * 5. A link that leads to one of those is taken: a link in a project to ~/.tars-private, to a folder inside it, to the
 *    home folder.
 * 5c. A `..` after a link is taken: the system follows the link and then goes up, while path.resolve drops the `..` on
 *    the text first (the Audit's M1 on #503: proj/lnk -> ~/.tars-private/accounts, then proj/lnk/../secrets).
 * 5b. A folder not made yet behind such a link is taken: no realpath answers for it, so its spelling alone was
 *    compared (found with the Windows suite, handed-folder-win32.test.ts, 2026-10-20).
 * 6. A folder that only looks like one of those is refused: a sibling named .tars-private-notes, a project under the
 *    home folder; or the check throws on a folder that does not exist, or while ~/.tars-private does not exist yet.
