/**
 * What a folder takes on the disk, without du (electron/platform/disk-usage.ts).
 * Settings, System lists each folder no agent owns with its size, which
 * orphan-folders.ts asked `du -sk`: Windows has no du on a user's PATH (only a
 * Git Bash shell puts Git's on it), and every folder read 0 KB there, the
 * confirm saying "Remove these 3 folders, 0 KB, for good?" (orphan-folders.spec.ts,
 * 2026-10-07).
 *
 * How it fails, written before the code:
 * 1. A folder reads 0, or only what lies at its top, a nested file left out.
 * 2. A file is counted twice, or for less than it holds.
 * 3. A link is followed out of the folder (a junction on Windows), and what
 *    it points to is counted, as du never does.
 * 4. A folder that is gone, or cannot be read, throws instead of counting nothing.
