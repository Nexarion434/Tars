/**
 * The helper the ACL tests read access lists with (read-dacl.ts).
 *
 * On CI (windows-latest, run 36419462139) it returned nothing and 22 tests
 * failed with "no DACL in ": the step's shell is PowerShell 7, the Windows
 * PowerShell 5.1 it started inherited PSModulePath, found PowerShell 7's
 * Microsoft.PowerShell.Security first, could not load it, and so had no
 * Get-Acl. It printed that to stderr, which the helper dropped, and exited 0.
 *
 * How it can fail, written before the code:
 *  1. A PSModulePath that puts a module 5.1 cannot load first (PowerShell 7's)
 *     leaves the read empty.
 *  2. A read that fails says only "no DACL in": not the command's stderr,
 *     not its exit code, not the path.
 *  3. A read that returns fewer lists than it was asked for is taken as whole,
 *     and the lists are matched to the wrong paths.
 *  4. The user's SID is read the same fragile way.
 *  5. An entry is compared by how SDDL spells its trustee, not by who it is:
 *     on CI (run 36421786193) the runner's account is the built-in
 *     Administrator, RID 500, which SDDL writes \`LA\`, never its SID, so an
 *     access list of exactly that user and SYSTEM failed against one built
 *     from the SID. Any alias does the same (SY, BA, BU, WD, a domain's).
 *  6. An alias that cannot be resolved is passed through, and a list is
 *     compared half by alias, half by SID.
 *  7. Normalizing loses what must stay exact: the protected flag, the kind,
 *     flags and rights of each entry, or an entry altogether.
 *
 * Case 1 is the CI condition, made here with a module manifest that asks for
 * PowerShell 7.0, first on the PSModulePath the test hands down.
