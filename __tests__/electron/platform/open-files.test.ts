/**
 * The files some processes hold open, by their real paths (platform/open-files.ts): what tells Tars that a new codex
 * session is the one the agent's own codex writes, when its first message does not say (services/codex-sessions.ts,
 * the Audit's M1 on #465). Measured on codex-cli 0.163.0: codex holds its rollout open from its first line to its
 * end, at rest included.
 *
 * The ways it fails:
 * 1. A file a process holds open not found: macOS's lsof names it by its real path (/private/var, not /var), and
 *    Linux's /proc/<pid>/fd links to it the way its kernel spells it.
 * 2. A file nobody holds, or one another process holds, said held: a session that is not the agent's is then bound.
 * 3. A process that is gone, or a pid that is no process, taken for an error: the others asked with it go unread.
 * 4. Windows, where no tool lists a process's files, answered as "none open": that reads as "the agent's codex does
 *    not hold this" when nobody can know. It is said unknown, undefined, and so is a reading that failed.
 * 5. lsof's lines misread: `p<pid>`, `f<fd>`, `n<name>`, a name with spaces in it, a deleted file's "(deleted)".
