/**
 * The bridge the renderer's Sentry SDK talks to main through.
 *
 * The window is sandboxed, so its preload cannot load @sentry/electron's own
 * preload: Tars's preload exposes the object that one would
 * (`window.__SENTRY_IPC__['sentry-ipc']`), with the renderer's errors passed
 * to main (IPCMode.Classic in main), where report.ts rebuilds them.
 *
 * How it fails, written before the code (2026-09-28):
 * 1. A function the renderer SDK calls is missing: it throws in the page, or
 *    falls back to a protocol main never registers.
 * 2. The renderer's scope reaches main: its user, extra, breadcrumbs and
 *    attachments would be merged into main's scope and ride on main's errors.
 *    So would its feedback, its logs, its metrics and its status pings.
 * 3. An SDK upgrade adds a function to its preload and Tars's bridge does not
 *    have it: the list is read from the installed SDK, not copied here.
