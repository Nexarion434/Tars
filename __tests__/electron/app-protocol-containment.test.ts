/**
 * The `app://` handler served any file on disk.
 *
 * `new URL()` collapses a literal `..` in the pathname but leaves `%2f` alone,
 * and the handler decoded AFTER parsing, so `..%2f..%2f` came back out as a
 * real traversal that `path.join` walked straight through. The scheme is
 * registered secure and CORS-enabled, so it is same-origin with the app's own
 * page, and a markdown image is fetched without a click and never passes
 * through `isSafeUrl`. A vault note, which any agent can write, holding
 *
 *     ![](app://-/a/..%2f..%2f..%2f.dorothy%2fapp-settings.json)
 *
 * read every provider API key the moment the note was opened.
 *
 * These tests pin the two halves: that the URL really does decode into a
 * traversal (so the fix is not guarding against nothing), and that the
 * containment rule rejects it.
