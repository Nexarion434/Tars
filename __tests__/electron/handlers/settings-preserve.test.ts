/**
 * Saving the Settings page must not delete what the page never had.
 *
 * `useSettings` fetches `~/.claude/settings.json` once when the page mounts and
 * sends that whole snapshot back on save. The window is created early in
 * startup and Tars writes the CLI hooks later in the same startup, so a page
 * opened in between holds `hooks: {}` for as long as it stays open, and the
 * save it makes minutes later used to write that empty block over the real
 * one. Measured at eight hook types before and none after, with `permissions`,
 * `enabledPlugins` and `includeCoAuthoredBy` going the same way. One file
 * serves the fourteen providers that run the claude binary, so every agent
 * lost its status reporting at once until Tars was next launched.
 *
 * Everything here runs against a temp HOME. The real file is read once, to
 * check the fixture below still has the shape of the thing being protected,
 * and is never written: forty agents are using it.
