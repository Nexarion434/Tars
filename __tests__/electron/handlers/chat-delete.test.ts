/**
 * Deleting a chat whose runner asks for work while it is being stopped (the
 * Audit's L6 on #379; ORCHESTRATOR-PER-CHAT.md 4.1, `chat_has_work`).
 *
 * How it fails, written before the fix (2026-10-13):
 * 1. The delete checks the runner's work, then stops it and removes it with
 *    the record: a request it filed while it was stopping stays at the worker,
 *    filed by a requester that no longer exists, whose answer nobody waits for.
 *    It must be checked again once the runner is stopped, and refused then.
 * 2. A delete with nothing out is refused, or leaves the runner or the record.
 *
 * The chats' handlers and store, the fleet and the removal are the real ones.
 * Replaced: electron, node-pty, and the stop, by one that files a request at a
 * worker in the runner's name as its CLI ends.
