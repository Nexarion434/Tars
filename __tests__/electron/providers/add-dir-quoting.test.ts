/**
 * The folders Tars hands a CLI (`--add-dir`, Gemini's `--include-directories`)
 * reach it as one argument each, whatever the home folder is called.
 *
 * Every provider wrote `--add-dir '${DATA_DIR}'` without escaping the quote,
 * and the scheduled builders `--add-dir "${DATA_DIR}"`, where `$` and a
 * backtick still expand. DATA_DIR is `~/.tars`, so the home folder's own
 * name went into the command line raw. What can go wrong, each checked below:
 *
 * 1. An apostrophe in the home (`/Users/o'neil`) closes the quote early: the
 *    rest of the line is parsed as shell, the quotes no longer pair up, and the
 *    command does not run at all.
 * 2. A home crafted to close the quote can add arguments of its own, such as a
 *    flag that turns off every permission prompt (`x' --dangerously-skip-permissions '`).
 * 3. A space must not split the folder into two arguments.
 * 4. `$` and a backtick must reach the CLI as characters, not be expanded or
 *    run, in the double-quoted scheduled builders as in the interactive one.
 * 5. A provider left out: every provider's command is checked, so one that
 *    still writes the folder raw fails here by name.
 * 6. The escape itself: an empty value, a value made only of quotes, and one
 *    with a line break stay one argument, unchanged.
 * 7. The scheduled builders of those providers write more than the data folder:
 *    the CLI's own path, its MCP config, the log, the project, the home and
 *    the task. Each of them sits under the home here, so each is covered, and
 *    the scheduled script runs whole, from `export HOME` to its last line.
 *
 * The oracle is a real POSIX shell (`sh`, from PATH): the command Tars built
 * runs in it against a stand-in for the CLI (a shell function, or a script
 * under the home for the builders that take a path to the CLI), which prints
 * each argument it was given followed by a NUL. codex's line starts it through
 * `env CODEX_HOME=<Tars's codex home>` on macOS and Linux (the Audit's L4 on
 * #465), which runs no shell function: there the stand-in is a script on the
 * PATH, which prints the CODEX_HOME it was handed first, a folder under the
 * home too. What the CLI would have
 * received is compared with what it should have received: the same command
 * built for a home with a plain name, whose argv is right by construction,
 * with that plain home replaced by the hostile one in every argument.
