/**
 * Every provider's command can be exec'd: the CLI takes the shell's place.
 *
 * spawnAgentSession runs `cd <dir> && exec <command>` in the agent's terminal,
 * so that the CLI, not the shell, leads the terminal and is what node-pty
 * names (core/agent-pty.ts, cliRunningIn). That holds only while each provider
 * builds one simple command, its quoted binary and the binary's arguments. A
 * leading assignment would have exec look for a program named `VAR=x`; a `;`,
 * `&&` or `|` would put the exec on the first part only and leave a shell
 * running the rest.
 *
 * So each provider's real command, with every option Tars can set, is run
 * here through bash in that shape, against a binary that says who its parent
 * is. With the exec it is this process: no shell was left in between.
