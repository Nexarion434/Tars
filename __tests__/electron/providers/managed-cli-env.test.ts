/**
 * The managed environment reaches every agent, on both spawn paths.
 *
 * Two functions start an agent's CLI: initAgentPty, for a restored or
 * renderer-started agent, and spawnAgentSession, for every API-driven one,
 * which is every orchestrator delegation, /dispatch, /message and /start. They
 * assembled their environments separately, so DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER shipped on
 * the first and was missing from the second, and half the fleet kept updating
 * itself mid-session. armTaskStartWatch had gone the same way one change
 * earlier: the pattern is the bug, not either omission.
 *
 * So the env belongs to spawnAgentPty now, the one place that actually starts
 * the process, and the tests below assert that rather than the variable: what
 * has to hold is that a caller CANNOT skip it, which is why the last one reads
 * the source for a direct pty.spawn.
 *
 * On the variable itself: the auto-updater is not what loses a dispatch, and
 * saying so is the point of the comment on managedCliEnv. It is off because
 * Tars updates claude itself, once (services/cli-updater.ts, and its tests in
 * cli-updater.test.ts), where the updater inside each session downloaded every
 * release once per session and asked each one for a restart.
