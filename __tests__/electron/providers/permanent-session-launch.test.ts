/**
 * A task given to an agent starts its permanent, interactive session (2.0.4,
 * the maintainer's decision of 2026-10-18: permanent agents, never a copy that
 * does one task and exits). Every launch with a task goes through the
 * provider's buildInteractiveCommand, so that is where a CLI's one-shot mode
 * must never be reached for.
 *
 * Each CLI's interactive form with a starting prompt, read from its own
 * `--help` on 2026-10-18: claude `-- <task>`; codex 0.x `[PROMPT]` (exec is
 * the one-shot); grok `[PROMPT]` "Initial prompt for the interactive session"
 * (`-p/--single` is the one-shot); pi 0.73 `[messages...]` (`-p/--print` is the
 * one-shot); gemini 0.64 `-i/--prompt-interactive` (a positional query ran
 * one-shot in older releases, `-p` is headless); opencode 1.19
 * `--prompt` on the TUI (`run` is the one-shot); amp has none: `-x/--execute`
 * runs once and exits, and its TUI takes a first message only from its input,
 * so the task is typed in once its CLI runs.
 *
 * Every way it can fail, written before the code:
 *  1. opencode is started as `opencode run <task>`, which exits after the task,
 *     instead of its TUI with `--prompt <task>`.
 *  2. amp is started as `amp -x <task>`, which exits after the task, or with the
 *     task anywhere on its command line.
 *  3. amp says nothing of its task being typed in, so no launch types it, and
 *     the TUI waits with no task.
 *  4. gemini gets its task as a bare query, one-shot on the releases before
 *     0.64, instead of `-i`.
 *  5. claude, codex, grok, pi or a provider that runs claude reach their
 *     one-shot flag (-p, --print, exec, --single) with a task.
 *  6. a CLI that takes its task as an argument loses it, or gets it cut.
 *  7. the task typed into amp goes in before its CLI runs (into the shell, which
 *     would run it as a command), or before its screen is up (lost).
 *  8. a CLI that never comes up, or is gone before its screen is, gets keys
 *     anyway, or the wait never ends.
 *  9. the task is typed more than once.
