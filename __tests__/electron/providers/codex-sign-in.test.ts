/**
 * Codex agents that start not signed in, and why (the Audit's L7 on #465, 2.0.4).
 *
 * Tars hands the codex it starts its own home (`env CODEX_HOME=<Tars's home>` on the line, the Audit's L4), so that
 * Tars and codex read and write one config.toml and one sessions folder. A user whose rc files set CODEX_HOME
 * elsewhere, where their login is, with Tars started from the Dock or Finder (no rc file read: Tars's home is then
 * ~/.codex), gets codex agents that are not signed in. Measured on codex-cli 0.163.0: a codex whose home has no login
 * shows "Welcome to Codex ... Sign in with ChatGPT ... Press enter to continue" and writes no session, so Tars saw
 * nothing, and the agent read as starting, then running, for good.
 *
 * The ways it fails:
 * 1. Not said: the agent's status says nothing of it, and whoever handed it a task waits.
 * 2. Said when it is not so: Tars's home signed in (its auth.json, or a login codex keeps elsewhere, its keyring:
 *    then asked of codex itself, `codex login status`, measured on 0.163: exit 0 "Logged in using ChatGPT", exit 1
 *    "Not logged in"); a key from Settings, which codex takes instead of a login (services/cli-keys.ts); a shell that
 *    sets no CODEX_HOME, or Tars's own folder under another writing; or the shell's home not signed in either, which
 *    is then not this.
 * 3. Said on a guess: a codex that could not answer (not there, failed, hung past its time) is no answer, and nothing
 *    is said; nor is a codex that exits 1 for something else than its login (a config it cannot read): only exit 1
 *    with its own words, "Not logged in", says a home is not signed in.
 * 4. The shell's CODEX_HOME misread: what an rc file prints on the way (a greeting, a prompt's escapes) taken for it,
 *    or one the shell does not set taken for a folder. It is read from a marked line of a login shell's own output.
 * 5. The window frozen while it is asked, or the login shell started at every launch: the shell and codex run off the
 *    main thread, the shell once per run once it has answered (one that failed or hung is asked again next time), and
 *    nothing on Windows, which reads no rc file.
 * 6. The login shown: signed in, `codex login status` names the account. Its output is looked at for "Not logged in"
 *    only, and never kept, logged or said.
