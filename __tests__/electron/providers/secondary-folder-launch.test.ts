/**
 * The folder an agent is handed besides its project, as the launch writes it on the CLI's line (claude's and codex's
 * --add-dir, gemini's and Qwen Code's --include-directories): never ~/.tars-private, whatever agents.json says. The
 * create_agent and update_agent routes refuse it since #480 (handed-folder.ts); an agent saved before them, through a
 * window path that did not check, or by hand in agents.json, still carried it to the launch (the Audit's L4 on #480).
 *
 * How it fails, written before the code:
 * 1. A launch hands ~/.tars-private, or a folder inside it, to the CLI.
 * 2. A launch hands a folder that holds it: the home folder, or the root.
 * 3. A launch hands a link in a project that leads to it.
 * 4. Over-refusal: a plain secondary folder is no longer on the line of a provider that hands one, or a launch
 *    throws instead of leaving the refused folder out.
 * 5. The template's folders (obsidianVaultPaths), which a launch hands with the same flag, hand any of those: they are
 *    read back from agents.json and templates.json under ~/.tars, which any agent can write (the Audit's L1 on #501).
 *    And over-refusal there: a plain vault beside a refused one is left out too.
