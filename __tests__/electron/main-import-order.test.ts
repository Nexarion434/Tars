 * every module after it is compiled from the cache it keeps (#163). A later
 * import put above it (github-watch, the Audit's gate of #234) is compiled
 * without it. The guard is not: it writes nothing and reads no data folder.
 *
 * How it fails: an import or a require that is not a type sits above either.
