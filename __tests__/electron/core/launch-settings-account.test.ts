/**
 * An agent's pinned Claude account is something its CLI reads once, at launch:
 * a pin that changes restarts it, through the same wait as a model or an
 * effort (agent-restart.ts), and a CLI already launched on it is left alone.
 *
 * What goes wrong if it is wrong, first:
 * - the pin missing from LaunchSettings: decide() compares what the CLI was
 *   launched with to the record, finds them equal, and never restarts it;
 * - an agent that never had a pin seen as changed: every agent would restart
 *   once the option exists.
