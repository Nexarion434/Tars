/**
 * A test build (`npm run electron:pack`, "Tars Sandbox") runs only on a home
 * of its own (the Audit's M1 on #477). Its own name gives it its own Electron
 * profile, so its own single-instance lock: opened from the Finder, the Dock
 * or `open`, without scripts/sandbox.sh, it started beside the real Tars, on
 * the real home: its agents, settings and tokens, its Telegram and Slack bots,
 * port 31415.
 *
 * Every way it can fail, written before the code (2026-10-19):
 *  B1. A sandbox build started on the account's own home (HOME is the home the
 *      password database names: nothing moved it) is not refused.
 *  B2. A sandbox build started by scripts/sandbox.sh (HOME ~/Tars-sandbox), or
 *      by the E2E fixture (a temporary HOME), is refused.
 *  B3. A release, which carries no mark, is refused on the real home.
 *  B4. The mark is read from anything but the build's own package.json (an
 *      environment variable, a setting an agent can write), so a release could
 *      be told it is a sandbox, or a sandbox that it is not; or a package.json
 *      that cannot be read takes a release for a sandbox.
 *  B5. The same home spelled another way (a trailing slash, a link to it) is
 *      taken for another one, and the build starts on the real home.
 *  B6. The stand-in for the password database's home, which an E2E needs to
 *      reach the refusal without the real home, is honoured outside an E2E run.
 *  B7. A sandbox build checks for updates every half hour like a release, and
 *      offers to download the real Tars (the Audit's L1).
