/**
 * A message waiting for a terminal, taken back because its request was
 * cancelled (core/task-cancel.ts; POST /api/tasks/:ref/cancel; PR D of 2.0.0):
 * withdrawWaiting in electron/core/pty-manager.ts. Written with its code, and
 * shown to bite by mutants (the bench of PR D).
 *
 * How it fails:
 * 1. The cancelled message is still typed once the person clears the field.
 * 2. Another request's message, waiting in the same terminal, goes with it.
 * 3. Its onDropped is called, so its asker is told the message was given up
 *    when it was cancelled; or its onWithdrawn is not called, so the route's
 *    "still held" reminder fires later about a message that no longer exists.
 * 4. The panel's count of what waits is not taken down.
