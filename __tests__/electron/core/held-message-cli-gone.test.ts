/**
 * A message held for a terminal is typed only while a CLI still runs in it
 * (the Audit's gate of #231, finding 5).
 *
 * A message waits in a terminal's queue while somebody types in it, or a
 * dialog is up. It was checked for a running CLI when it was handed over, and
 * not again when it finally went in: if the CLI stopped meanwhile, the text
 * went to the shell's prompt, where each newline runs a line as a command.
 * That is any held message: a teammate's, a Telegram one, Noah's answer.
 *
 * How it fails, written before the code (2026-09-28):
 * 1. The CLI stops while a message is held, and the message is typed into
 *    the shell.
 * 2. Its sender is never told it did not go.
 * 3. Over-correction: with the CLI still there, a held message never goes.
 * 4. What the writer is told for a real agent terminal is wrong: a terminal
 *    back at its shell reads as a CLI, or one running the CLI reads as
 *    stopped, or a terminal Tars did not start as an agent's is refused.
