/**
 * Every start of a chat's runner takes a slot first, whoever starts it
 * (ORCHESTRATOR-PER-CHAT.md v2.2, 4.2; the Audit's M5; PR D of 2.0.0): the
 * gate in electron/core/agent-launch.ts, which services/chat-runners.ts sets
 * and launchAgent and spawnAgentSession consult. Written with its code, and
 * shown to bite by mutants.
 *
 * How it fails:
 * 1. A start the gate refuses is launched anyway, or refused without why.
 * 2. A slot taken for a start is never given back, or given back before the
 *    launch is done.
 * 3. With no gate set (no chats), a start is held up.
