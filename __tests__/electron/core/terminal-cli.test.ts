/**
 * Whose SessionStart may register a session for an agent: only the CLI Tars
 * launched in that agent's terminal.
 *
 * Measured on 2026-10-13 (claude 2.1.296): a `claude -p` run from an agent's
 * own Bash tool inherited CLAUDE_AGENT_ID, its token and Tars's hooks; its
 * SessionStart registered it as the agent's session, its Stop marked the
 * agent completed with its one-word answer, the real session's posts were
 * dropped as stale, and a restart resumed the wrong conversation. Claude Code
 * hands its hooks CLAUDE_PID, its own pid: the agent's claude was the
 * terminal's process itself (pty pid 86550, parent Tars), the nested one
 * 81386, whose hook saw CLAUDE_PID=81386.
 *
 * How it fails, written before the code:
 *  1. A nested CLI (its pid is not the terminal's, nor a child of it)
 *     registers: the bug.
 *  2. Over-correction: the terminal's own CLI is refused when it is the
 *     terminal's process itself (the shell exec'd it, as measured).
 *  3. Over-correction: refused when a shell in the terminal started it, so
 *     it is the terminal process's child.
 *  4. A post that names no CLI pid (Gemini, a claude that does not set
 *     CLAUDE_PID, a hook from before this change) is refused, where it
 *     registered before: nothing to compare, so nothing changes.
 *  5. A malformed pid ("abc", "0", "-3", "1.5", "12 34", a number past any
 *     pid) is taken for one, or reaches `ps` as an argument: refused.
 *  6. The parent cannot be read (the process is gone, `ps` fails): taken as
 *     the terminal's. Refused: nothing shows it is.
 *  7. The agent has no terminal Tars knows of: refused, where it registered
 *     before. Nothing to compare: accepted as before.
 *  8. Windows, where there is no `ps`: every session refused, or the lookup
 *     throws. Only the equal pid is checked there; anything else is accepted
 *     as before.
