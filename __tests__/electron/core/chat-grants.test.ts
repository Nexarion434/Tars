/**
 * A deleted chat's runner leaves its copy of the project's settings.local.json behind, then its worktree goes
 * (electron/core/chat-grants.ts, called by services/chat-runners.ts before removeAgent). Claude Code puts that file
 * in the global git ignore, so a copy left there keeps the whole worktree as an ignored file (GATE-2.0.0-BULLETS, 1).
 *
 * How it fails, written before the fix of #394's gate (2026-10-13; cases 1 and 4 to 7 after the first cut, which
 * the gate's mutants H4 and H5 showed had no witness):
 * 1. The runner's copy stays, and the worktree with it.
 * 2. (the gate's M1) The worktree's `.claude` is a link to the project's (a repository that tracks it as one, or an
 *    agent that made it): the file deleted is the project's own, the user's grants.
 * 3. The worktree itself is reached through a link, and its real `.claude` is taken for a stranger's: nothing goes.
 * 4. (H4) settings.local.json is a link: the link goes, though it is no copy of Tars's; it must stay, and keep the
 *    worktree, which says why.
 * 5. (H5) The runner works somewhere else than the chat's own worktree (the project's root, another chat's): its
 *    file there is deleted.
 * 6. `.claude` holds more than the file: the rest goes with it.
 * 7. A worktree with no `.claude`, or none at all, throws.
 * 8. (the delta gate's L1) Above the worktree: the chat's folder is itself a link to the project
 *    (`.worktrees/chat-x -> ..`). lstat follows it, `.claude` is the project's real folder and its file a regular one:
 *    the project's own grants are deleted. Whatever the layout, the file the worktree reaches must never be the
 *    project's own.
 * 9. (QA's D2 on #394's delta) The worktree's `.claude` is a link to a folder other than the project's: another
 *    worktree's, or the user's own ~/.claude. The realpath check knows only the project's file, so without the check
 *    that `.claude` is no link, unlink goes through it and that folder's settings.local.json is deleted. Case 2 links
 *    to the project's `.claude`, which the realpath check guards too: it never showed the link check was needed.
