/**
 * A terminal that ends after its agent was given another one is not the
 * agent's news (the Frontend's finding of 05/10, electron/core/agent-manager.ts).
 *
 * initAgentPty's exit handler guarded the agent's status with "only if this
 * PTY is still the active one", but sent agent:complete whatever the answer.
 * A restart ends the old terminal after the new one has started, so the
 * window moved the agent's current task to done, with the new terminal's
 * screen as its summary.
 *
 * How it fails, written before the code (2026-10-05):
 * 1. A terminal that ends after it was replaced sends agent:complete.
 * 2. Over-correction: the agent's own terminal ending no longer does.
 * 3. A replaced terminal's exit changes the agent's status (the guard that
 *    already held).
 * And from the e2e of this fix (agent-stopped.spec.ts, red on its first
 * version): a stop clears the agent's terminal before it ends it, and the
 * window reads who stopped it and why only by fetching the fleet again,
 * which this agent:complete made it do (its status event is patched, not
 * fetched). So:
 * 4. The terminal a stop ended, the agent having no other, no longer sends
 *    agent:complete, and the window shows a stop without who or why. Pinned
 *    until the window fetches on the stop's own status event.
 * Which it does since #329 (the follow-ups of 06/10): the window fetches the
 * fleet on a `stopped` status event, and 4 turns round.
 * 4. The terminal a stop ended sends agent:complete: it is no longer the
 *    agent's, and the window takes it for the agent's task done.
