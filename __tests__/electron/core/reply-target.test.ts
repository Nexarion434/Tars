/**
 * Who a worker's message reaches when it names its orchestrator rather than an
 * id (ORCHESTRATOR-PER-CHAT.md v2.2, 4.3 "Replies"; the Audit's R5 on v2; PR D
 * of 2.0.0): electron/core/reply-target.ts, read by /dispatch and /message.
 *
 * With several chats, the agent that asked a worker for its current task may
 * be a chat's runner, not the project's orchestrator. A worker that answers
 * "the orchestrator", by the role word or by its name, means whoever asked it;
 * one that answers by an id means that id.
 *
 * How it fails, written before the code (2026-10-12):
 * 1. An explicit agent id is rerouted: a worker writing to the persistent
 *    orchestrator about something else reaches a chat instead (R5).
 * 2. "requester", "orchestrator" or the orchestrator's name reach the
 *    persistent orchestrator while a chat's runner asked for the current task,
 *    so chat A's result lands in Main.
 * 3. "orchestrator" reaches a plain worker that asked (a worker is not an
 *    orchestrator), instead of the project's orchestrator.
 * 4. A worker with no current task, writing to "requester", reaches nobody,
 *    instead of the project's orchestrator.
 * 5. The words resolve without a caller (the shared token), or to another
 *    project's orchestrator, or a chat's runner is taken for the project's
 *    orchestrator.
 * 6. A word that is none of these reaches anyone.
