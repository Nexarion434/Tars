 * What runs in an agent's terminal, read from a real one.
 *
 * Every other test of cliRunningIn gives node-pty's answer by hand, and gave
 * it the shape the Dashboard opens: an interactive `bash -l`, where a typed
 * command leads a process group of its own. None opened the terminal the API
 * opens, `bash -l -c "cd ... && <cli>"`, where a shell without job control
 * kept the CLI in its own group and node-pty named `bash` for the CLI's whole
 * life. So every agent the API had started read as no CLI while its claude
 * ran, the orchestrator among them, and the tests stayed green (the Audit's
 * gate of #126, 2026-09-23).
 *
 * node-pty is the real one here, under Node rather than Electron: its N-API
 * build loads in both. `/bin/sleep` stands in for the CLI, since what is read
 * is which process leads the terminal, not what that process is.
 *
 * On Linux node-pty names the process by its path (`/bin/sleep`), on macOS by
 * its name (`sleep`); cliRunningIn takes either, and so does `until`.
