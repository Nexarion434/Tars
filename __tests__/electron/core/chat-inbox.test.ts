/**
 * Who a note for "the project's orchestrator" goes to (PR F of 2.0.0): the
 * kanban's landing note, the error triage's, a stall nobody asked for.
 *
 * How it fails, written before the code:
 * 1. A project with no chats (the chats not loaded, no orchestrator migrated
 *    yet) sends its notes nowhere, where they went to its orchestrator.
 * 2. (The Audit's L3 on #386) A non-Main chat made the inbox before its first
 *    send has no runner: the notes go into the void, where they reached the
 *    orchestrator before. Until the chat has a runner, Main's orchestrator
 *    takes them.
 * 3. An inbox chat whose runner exists, asleep, is skipped for the
 *    orchestrator: the note belongs to that chat, and waits for it as a note
 *    waits for any agent at rest.
 * 4. Another project's orchestrator, or a chat's runner, is taken for this
 *    project's orchestrator.
