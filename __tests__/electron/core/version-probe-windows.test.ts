/**
 * A version probe that has answered is not ended by its id on Windows.
 *
 * Upstream 1.9.3 ends a probe's group once it has answered (version-probe.ts,
 * its test 7), and the merge into the fork made that `taskkill /T` on win32.
 * But Node lets go of a process's handle once it has read its exit, and
 * Windows then hands the id out again, freed ids first: Settings probes a
 * dozen CLIs at once, so the id of one that answered can be another probe's,
 * or any process's, by the time its taskkill runs, and /T ends that one's
 * tree. acp/client.ts holds the same line (acp-exited-root.test.ts).
 *
 * How it fails, written before the code (2026-10-07):
 * 1. A probe that answered runs taskkill on its id.
 * 2. (the control) A probe cut by its timeout, still running, is no longer
 *    ended by taskkill on its id, and 1 proves nothing.
