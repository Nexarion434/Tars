/**
 * What a quit does to the agents' terminals (the Orchestrator's brief after
 * #231; the crash report of #231's proof).
 *
 * killAllPty sent SIGHUP to each terminal's shell and returned, inside a
 * synchronous before-quit. The shell relays the hangup to its jobs, so the
 * CLIs died, 0.7 to 1.8 s later, measured in 21 quits; but nothing made sure
 * of it, and node-pty's exit callbacks, which need the event loop, came after
 * the quit had moved on: one of them was delivered during Electron's final
 * cleanup, threw from pty.node's ThreadSafeFunction, and aborted the app.
 *
 * Here each "terminal" is a real process group, standing where node-pty's
 * shell would: a leader and a child in a group of its own, as a CLI started
 * from an interactive shell is.
 *
 * How it fails, written before the code (2026-09-28):
 * 1. A CLI that does not die on the hangup outlives the quit.
 * 2. Its own children (an MCP server) outlive it, in its group.
 * 3. The quit waits the whole grace when everything ended at once.
 * 4. It returns before the terminals' exits were delivered, so they come
 *    during Electron's teardown (the abort).
 * 5. A process that is not in a terminal's tree is signalled.
 * 6. Over-correction: a CLI that ends on the hangup is killed before it has
 *    had its time, and loses what it writes when it exits.
 *
 * And from the Audit's gate of #235 (2026-09-28):
 * 7. The stubborn fixture was not stubborn: `trap '' HUP TERM` spliced into a
 *    single-quoted `sh -c` became `trap HUP TERM`, SIGHUP kept its default,
 *    and a quit with no SIGKILL at all passed. The fixture is checked to
 *    survive SIGHUP before anything is trusted to it.
 * 8. Something the CLI starts after the hangup, in a group of its own, is not
 *    in the tree read before it, and outlives the quit.
 * 9. node-pty delivers an exit about 200 ms after the process ended: the quit
 *    goes on before it arrives.
 * 10. The user's own shell panel (the quick terminal) is not an agent: a job
 *    left there with nohup or disown survives the quit, as in any terminal
 *    app. Only the shell itself is ended if the hangup does not end it, or the
 *    quit would wait on it forever (node-pty's waitpid).
 * 11. ps is read back to back once the exits are in, instead of once a pause.
 * 12. The hangup waits for the event loop: a quit that runs something
 *    synchronous next (the delegated runs' own grace) starts the terminals'
 *    grace only after it, and the two add up.
