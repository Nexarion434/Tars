/**
 * The ceiling for delegated runs (ORCHESTRATOR-PER-CHAT.md v2.2, 4.4 item 2):
 * electron/core/permission-ceiling.ts.
 *
 * A run over ACP is the asker's to start and ends with its turn: it runs at
 * the narrower of the asker's mode and the target's own, in the order
 * plan < normal < auto < bypass. A persistent worker keeps the mode it was
 * given, so a message to it from a narrower asker is only marked as such.
 *
 * How it fails, written before the code (2026-10-12):
 * 1. The order is wrong: auto above bypass, plan above normal, or the clamp
 *    takes the broader of the two.
 * 2. A run nobody asked (Tars itself, the window) is clamped, or a run asked
 *    by an agent Tars no longer knows takes the target's broader mode.
 * 3. An agent's mode is read differently from how its launch reads it: a
 *    record with no permissionMode is normal (auto with the old
 *    skipPermissions), and a value that is none of the four is read broader
 *    than normal.
 * 4. The mark is written when the sender is as broad as the receiver or
 *    broader, or missing when it is narrower.
 * 5. The mark carries anything but the two mode words: it goes before the
 *    message, in Tars's voice.
