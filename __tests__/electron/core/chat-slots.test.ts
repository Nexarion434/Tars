/**
 * The rules a chat's runner is made and scheduled by (ORCHESTRATOR-PER-CHAT.md
 * v2.2, 4.2; PR D of 2.0.0): its name, its worktree and where its branch
 * starts, which runner sleeps to free a slot, which runners a launch after a
 * crash resumes, and the sentence a full limit answers with
 * (electron/core/chat-slots.ts). Pure: the fleet, git and the RAM are read by
 * services/chat-runners.ts and handed in.
 *
 * How it fails, written before the code (2026-10-12):
 * The runner
 * 1. A runner is named like the orchestrator, so a worker cannot tell two
 *    chats apart in its sender line: it must read "<orchestrator> · <title>".
 * 2. Its worktree lands outside the project's .worktrees, or under a name a
 *    chat id can steer (a path, `..`), or two chats share one.
 * 3. Its branch starts from the root's current branch (whatever someone
 *    checked out there) instead of origin's default branch, or from nothing
 *    when there is no remote though a local default branch exists.
 * The slots
 * 4. Main's runner (the persistent orchestrator, which never sleeps) is put to
 *    sleep to free a slot.
 * 5. A runner the sleep rule refuses (in a turn, a message on its way, work
 *    out, a draft) is put to sleep anyway.
 * 6. The most recently active idle runner is chosen rather than the least.
 * 7. A choice is made when nobody may sleep: a slot freed by killing work.
 * After a crash
 * 8. More runners are resumed than the limit leaves slots, or the least
 *    recently active ones first, or a negative count of slots resumes some.
 * The refusal
 * 9. The sentence of a full limit does not say how many, the RAM and the rule,
 *    and who works: the user cannot act on it.
 * The record's runner (the Audit's Info on #361, written before the code, 2026-10-13)
 * chats.json sits in ~/.dorothy, which every agent may write: a record's
 * runnerId is a claim, which the fleet confirms or not.
 * 10. A chat other than Main names an agent that is not its runner (a worker,
 *     the orchestrator, another chat's runner), and Tars types into it,
 *     launches it, counts it in a slot or puts it to sleep.
 * 11. Main names an agent that is not the project's orchestrator (a worker, a
 *     chat's runner, another project's orchestrator), and is treated as Main.
 * 12. A runner of this chat's id but of another project passes.
 * 13. A chat with no runner yet, or whose agent was deleted, reads as a forged
 *     one: the first must make its runner, the second say it is gone.
 * A runner's kind (the Audit's L1 on #379, written before the code, 2026-10-13)
 * agents.json is in ~/.dorothy too, and `kind: 'chat'` gives the orchestrator's
 * powers: at launch, a runner keeps it only while a chat names it.
 * 14. An agent marked kind chat that no chat names (no chatId, a chat that is
 *     gone, a chat naming another agent, a chat of another project) keeps the
 *     kind, and the powers with it.
 * 15. A runner its chat names loses its kind; an agent of no chat is listed.
 * The place (the Audit's R9 on #379)
 * 16. A letter that is not hex reaches the runner's folder name.
 * The refusal of its worktree (#394's gate, written before the code, 2026-10-13)
 * git writes its progress to stderr too, and the page shows that text whole.
 * 17. The page reads git's progress line ("Preparing worktree (new branch
 *     'chat/1a2b3c4d')") before the reason, or the "fatal: " that heads it.
 * 18. A refusal of several lines (an error, then the fatal) loses one, or keeps
 *     git's hints with them.
 * 19. git says nothing a user can read (no stderr, only its progress, a git
 *     stopped by the timeout): the page gets an empty reason or the progress,
 *     instead of Tars's own sentence.
 * 20. git's line ends with a period, and the page reads two.
 * The orchestrator off claude (2.0.1, written before the code, 2026-10-13)
 * A chat other than Main runs on its orchestrator's CLI, claude only (the
 * Audit's L4 on #379). 2.0.0 read that rule only on the way to a launch: a
 * runner still running when its orchestrator left claude took its chat's
 * messages on claude.
 * 21. A send to a chat other than Main goes in while the orchestrator is off
 *     claude, because its runner is still running.
 * 22. Main is refused, though its runner is the orchestrator itself, on
 *     whatever CLI it runs.
 * 23. A chat is refused while its orchestrator runs claude, or a project with
 *     no orchestrator answers this refusal instead of its own.
 * 24. The refusal does not say why, or the one of a runner still running does
 *     not say what becomes of it: its turn, the answers it waits for, and that
 *     nothing more from the chat reaches it.
 * 25. The refusal of a runner that is not running says that it runs.
 * And from `git worktree remove` (the Audit's L1 on #398, written before the code, 2026-10-13)
 * 26. git ends its line with a semicolon before an unprefixed hint ("cannot
 *     remove a locked working tree;" then "use 'remove -f -f' ..."): the
 *     sentence reads "tree;)".
 * A start on its way (2.0.2, QA's Info on #397, written before the code, 2026-10-13)
 * A runner restarting with no prompt (to follow a new orchestrator) holds its
 * slot while its start is on its way, and is idle a moment later.
 * 27. A full limit answers chat_limit at its first look at such a runner,
 *     naming a chat that has nothing to do, instead of looking again.
 * 28. Main, or a runner being started for the send in hand, is looked at
 *     again: the first never sleeps, the second is about to work.
 * 29. A refusal that does not pass by itself (in a turn, work owed, a draft
 *     that does not settle) is looked at again, or one that does (a Stop
 *     hook's tail, no process table, a message settling) no longer is.
