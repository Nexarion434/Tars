/**
 * What tells our own agents.json from a file somebody else wrote.
 *
 * saveAgents stopped reading agents.json back to make its backup and keeps the
 * generation it wrote in memory instead, using it only while the file on disk
 * is still the one that rename put there. It decides that on a stamp taken
 * right after its own rename: size, modification time and inode. If that stamp
 * ever said yes to a file somebody else wrote, the backup would hold our
 * generation and the next save would put ours on disk, so the other writer's
 * content would be gone from both files with nothing to recover it from.
 *
 * The two tests below are the two ways a foreign writer can reach that file
 * with the size unchanged, which is the case the size alone cannot catch: a
 * rewrite in place, which keeps the inode and moves the time, and a rename,
 * which moves the inode and can carry any time a tool cares to set. Each one
 * has to be recognised as foreign and backed up.
 *
 * Measured on 2026-09-18: this filesystem gives mtime a true nanosecond
 * resolution (six successive writes, six distinct values), so the time cannot
 * repeat by accident. A tool that restores timestamps through utimensat, `cp
 * -p` or `touch -r`, can reproduce one exactly, which is why the second test
 * forges it rather than trusting that nothing can.
