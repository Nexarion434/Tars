/**
 * A task reaches the CLI as it was written, even with a tab in it (the Audit's
 * table on a3d7c125, item C).
 *
 * A launch from the window or from a chat types `cd '<dir>' && <cli> ... '<task>'`
 * into the agent's bash, at its prompt (writeProgrammaticInput, without a
 * paste). Readline reads what is typed as keys: a tab inside the quoted task
 * is the completion key, so the task was cut, or completed with file names,
 * or held on "Display all 40 possibilities? (y or n)", which ate the next
 * letters typed. macOS's /bin/bash is 3.2, whose readline knows no bracketed
 * paste to protect it; a newer bash on Linux completes a typed tab all the same.
 *
 * The bytes Tars writes are fed to a real interactive bash in a real terminal
 * (Python's pty module, on macOS and Linux alike), and the "CLI" is a script
 * that records the arguments it was given.
 *
 * How it fails, written before the code (2026-09-28):
 * 1. A tab in the task: the CLI gets something other than the task, or never
 *    runs.
 * 2. A newline in the task: the same, or the rest runs as a second command.
 * 3. The task goes through a file, and the file is left behind, or readable by
 *    another user, or in a folder others can list.
 * 4. The line typed still carries the task, where a tab is still a key.
 * 5. Quotes, `$`, backticks and `!` in the task are read by the shell once
 *    more on the way.
 * 6. Over-correction: a command with no tab and no newline is no longer typed
 *    as it is, so the terminal stops showing what was launched.
 * 7. (the Audit's gate of #224) The folder is made once and reused whenever it
 *    exists: on a multi-user Linux whose /tmp is cleaned, another user can
 *    make a folder of that name, and swap the file Tars writes in it before
 *    the shell reads it (reproduced). Before each reuse, the folder must be a
 *    directory and not a link, owned by this user, and closed to others;
 *    otherwise a new one is made, and the one found is left untouched.
