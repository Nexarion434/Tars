/**
 * codex's approval dialogs on an agent's screen (2.0.4).
 *
 * codex says in no file that it waits on an approval: its terminal is where Tars sees one (codexDialogOnScreen),
 * for the agent's status (services/codex-sessions.ts) and so that nothing is typed into it (dialogOnScreen), where
 * an Enter answers it. Measured on codex-cli 0.163.0 in normal mode, asked to call a tool of an MCP server: before
 * each call it draws a form, the rows below as the PTY drew them (120x30, rendered by xterm), and calls nothing
 * until it is answered; Enter submits the option it shows selected, Allow. A command it wants to run outside its
 * sandbox gets the other dialog, its title and answers from codex's own strings.
 *
 * The ways it fails:
 * 1. The tool call's form not seen: the agent reads running while codex waits for good, and a message delivered
 *    into it ends on an Enter that allows the call in the user's name.
 * 2. A command's dialog not seen.
 * 3. What it asks about lost: the line must name the tool, or the command.
 * 4. An option row read as what it asks about, or the end of one carried onto the next row: in a terminal narrower
 *    than the form (an agent's panel, 86 columns in the specs), "Always allow"'s description runs onto a row of
 *    its own.
 * 5. A false alarm: a title quoted in the conversation, with no answer under it.
