/**
 * Every terminal the main process ends goes through killPty (audit A22,
 * matrix row 17).
 *
 * electron/core/pty-kill.ts ends a node-pty terminal without node-pty's
 * `AttachConsole failed` on Windows; e2e/pty-kill.spec.ts proves the kill
 * sites that exist today go through it, in the real app. This is the guard
 * for the next one: a `pty.kill()` written anywhere else brings the failure
 * back, on Windows only, where nobody writing it on a Mac would see it.
 *
 * How it can fail (2026-09-25; the E2E spec came first and was seen red on
 * the unwired build, this guard was then run red against the unwired tree):
 * 1. A node-pty terminal (an IPty, however it is reached: a map's get, an
 *    optional chain, a parameter) is ended with its own kill() anywhere in the
 *    main process but pty-kill.ts. Run against the unwired tree, this lists
 *    the 18 sites the lot wired; with one of them put back, it lists that one.
 * 2. A kill() whose receiver the type checker cannot name (`any`) is not
 *    looked at, so a terminal behind an untyped map slips through.
 * 3. The scan reads no file, or not the ones the app is built from, and finds
 *    nothing for that reason: it reads electron/tsconfig.json's own file list,
 *    and must see the ChildProcess kills of acp/client.ts, which stay.
