/**
 * Resuming an agent's conversation after a restart.
 *
 * Updating Tars restarts Electron, which kills every PTY, and every agent came
 * back with an empty conversation. The session id was recorded but never
 * survived the restart: `currentSessionId` is ownership and is cleared on load
 * on purpose, so a second field records where the work got to.
 *
 * The part that has to be right is the refusal. `claude --resume <id>` exits
 * rather than starting when the transcript is gone, so an id that cannot be
 * backed by a file on disk must never reach the command line: an agent that
 * starts fresh is a worse outcome than resuming, and an agent that does not
 * start at all is much worse than both.

/**
 * A project reached through a symlink.
 *
 * Claude Code files a transcript under the real path of the directory it runs
 * in; Tars looked under the path as it stored it. On a project reached through
 * a symlink (anything under /tmp, which is /private/tmp on macOS, or a linked
 * checkout) the two encode to different directories, so the first start after
 * launch, the settings restart and agent.restart all silently started a new
 * conversation (QA's gate of #138, seen in the app, and its unit test, here).
 *
 * How this can fail, written before the fix:
 * 1. the transcript claude filed under the real path is not found through the symlinked path;
 * 2. the saved spelling stops being looked under, and a transcript filed there is lost;
 * 3. a saved path that no longer exists throws while it is resolved, and fails the start instead of starting fresh;
 * 4. a worktree reached through a symlink, which is where such an agent ran, is not resolved either.
