/**
 * Quitting Tars ends its delegated runs, before the app exits.
 *
 * Measured on #197 (2026-09-24, claude-agent-acp 0.81.1, app.quit() in a
 * sandbox Tars): before-quit did nothing for a delegated run. A run that still
 * answered ended by itself about 2.4 s after the quit, once its stdin closed.
 * A run whose adapter was wedged (SIGSTOP) was whole 14 s later, npm, adapter,
 * claude, zsh and sleep, reparented to launchd. The stop path cannot serve at
 * quit: it reads ps asynchronously and sends its SIGKILL two seconds on, and
 * neither outlives the process.
 *
 * How it fails, written before the code (2026-09-24):
 * 1. A run is left running when the quit returns: its processes outlive Tars.
 * 2. A stuck run (the process Tars spawned SIGSTOPped, commands ignoring
 *    SIGTERM) outlives it: only a SIGKILL, sent before the quit returns, ends it.
 * 3. The commands the CLI ran in process groups of their own outlive it.
 * 4. A run that ends on SIGTERM is held for the whole grace anyway, and the
 *    quit takes longer than it has to.
 * 5. The quit is held without bound by a run that will not die.
 * 6. Over-reach: a process group that is not a run's, or Tars's own, is signalled.
 * 7. Without ps, nothing is ended, where the process Tars spawned still has to go.
 * 8. The quit never calls it.
 * 9. (the Audit's gate of #199) A ps that hangs holds the quit for every read:
 *    three reads at 2 s each stretched it to 6.5 s. One deadline bounds them all.
 * 10. (same gate) With no run under way, ps is run anyway: the shortcut that
 *    skips it had no test, and a mutant that removed it survived.
 *
 * On win32 (audit A21, and the phase 0 run where ps was ENOENT at every quit):
 * 11. The quit ends each run's root alone, `child.kill()`, and what runs under
 *    it outlives Tars. There the tree is ended by taskkill /T /F run while the
 *    quit waits (platform/kill-tree.ts), and taskkill takes the place of ps in
 *    cases 7, 9 and 10: missing, hung, and not run at all for no run.
 * Every case runs on every platform with the same assertions. What differs on
 * win32: the witness that the commands are out of the naive kill's reach is
 * their parentage rather than their group; a run cannot be made stuck with
 * SIGSTOP, which Windows does not have, and does not need to be, since
 * taskkill /F asks nothing of the process it ends; and a process is alive
 * until Windows says it has exited, there being no zombie to tell apart.
