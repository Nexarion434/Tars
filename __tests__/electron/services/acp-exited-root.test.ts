/**
 * A delegated run whose agent has already exited is not ended by its id on
 * Windows (audit A21, win-reviewer's gate of 2026-09-25).
 *
 * Windows reuses a process id once nothing holds the process's handle, and
 * Node lets go of it when it has read the exit. taskkill /PID <id> /T then
 * ends whatever took that id, and everything under it. So stop() and the
 * quit end a tree only while the agent that leads it still runs.
 *
 * How it fails, written before the code (2026-09-25):
 * 1. stop() of a session whose agent's exit was read runs taskkill on its id.
 * 2. releaseForQuit() of that session hands its id to the quit, which runs
 *    taskkill on it.
 * 3. (the control) stop() of a session whose agent still runs does not run
 *    taskkill, and the guards above prove nothing.
