/**
 * Noah's conversation with the super chat leaves the directory the agents are
 * handed, and no message is lost on the way.
 *
 * Measured on b17db0f: `~/.dorothy/overseer.json`, 148,654 bytes, 344 message
 * objects, mode 0644. Every agent is started with `--add-dir ~/.dorothy`, so
 * reading it took no API call, no token and no permission prompt: an `ls` of
 * the directory it was pointed at, and a `cat`. It now lives in
 * `~/.tars-private/`, which is handed to nothing.
 *
 * That is a smaller claim than it sounds, and the tests do not pretend
 * otherwise: an agent whose Bash can read $HOME can still read the new path if
 * it goes looking for it, and 37 of the 42 agents on this machine run with
 * `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. What moves is the file being *in* the
 * directory the agent is given, on the listing it gets for free. Closing the
 * rest takes a sandbox.
 *
 * So what is tested here is the migration, because it handles Noah's own data:
 * it moves, it verifies before it deletes, it leaves the old file alone when
 * it cannot finish, it does not run twice, and the Chat keeps reading the
 * history throughout.
