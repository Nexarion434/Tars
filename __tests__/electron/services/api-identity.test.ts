 * the whole machine that every agent can read, and name itself in
 * X-Tars-Caller-Id. The server believed the name. So an agent could put a
 * colleague's id in that header and read the colleague's project room, or
 * post in it, under the colleague's name. An agent now calls with a token
 * minted for its own process, and a call on the shared token is nobody,
 * whatever headers come with it.
 *
 * These boot the real server on a port of their own and speak HTTP to it: the
 * real authentication block, the real bus and agent routes, tokens from the
 * real registry, and at the end the real MCP clients. Nothing is called
 * directly that a request would not reach the same way.
