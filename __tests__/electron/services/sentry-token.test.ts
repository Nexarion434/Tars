/**
 * The Sentry token, out of agents' reach (the Audit's #242 and #292 gates): it reads Noah's Sentry organisation, user
 * reports included, and ~/.dorothy, where app-settings.json lives, is in every agent's --add-dir. It is kept in
 * ~/.tars-private, as the Hermes token is since 1.9.2, and the settings in memory still carry it, so the triage and
 * the Settings page read it where they did.
 *
 * How it can fail, written before the code:
 * 1. A save writes the token into app-settings.json again.
 * 2. A token saved before (in app-settings.json) stays there after the first start, or is lost on its way out.
 * 3. A token left in app-settings.json by an older Tars that ran since does not win over the one in ~/.tars-private:
 *    the older Tars wrote it last.
 * 4. The private file is readable by anybody but its owner.
 * 5. A token cleared in Settings stays in the private file, and comes back at the next start.
 * 6. The settings the app holds lack the token once it moved, so the triage stops.
 * 7. The other settings are lost or changed on the way.
