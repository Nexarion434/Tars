/**
 * What the Review page lists as changed, and the patch it shows for a file.
 *
 * The Audit reproduced the page in a sandboxed Tars on throwaway repositories (DIAG-REVIEW.md, 01/10): every case
 * below came back without an error, and wrong.
 *
 * How this can fail, written before the code:
 * 1. a renamed file is listed as "old => new", modified, +0 -0, and its patch is empty;
 * 2. a name with accents comes back quoted and escaped ("caf\303\251 ..."), and its patch is empty;
 * 3. an untracked binary is counted in "lines" and its bytes are shown as added text;
 * 4. a file changed both in a commit since the base and in the working tree is counted once, by the larger of the two;
 *    and a fix that adds the two counts doubles the unstaged changes of a branch with no base;
 * 5. a one-line untracked file counts +2, and its patch ends on an empty added line;
 * 6. in a repository with no commit yet, a staged file is missing and the branch reads "HEAD".
 * And what must not change: a modified, a deleted, a tracked binary and an oddly named file, and the commits ahead.
 *
 * Real git, real repositories in a temporary folder, the real reviewDiff and fileDiff.
