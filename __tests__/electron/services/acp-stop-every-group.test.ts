/**
 * A stopped run ends every command its CLI started, the ones in process
 * groups of their own included (the Audit's gate of #191).
 *
 * #191 put the process Tars spawns in a group of its own and signals that
 * group. Claude Code's Bash tool runs each command in a group of its own,
 * though. Measured by the Audit with claude-agent-acp 0.81.1: a run whose
 * claude was wedged (SIGSTOP) was stopped, npm, the adapter and claude died
 * with their group, and the `zsh -c` and its `sleep 301` lived on, reparented
 * to launchd, until killed by hand. Only a CLI that cooperates ended them.
 *
 * How it fails, written before the code (2026-09-24):
 * 1. A command started in a group of its own outlives the stop, when it
 *    ignores SIGTERM and when the process that started it cannot pass the
 *    stop on (here the fake agent ignores SIGTERM and never asks it to go).
 * 2. A command in a group of its own that would end on SIGTERM is only
 *    reached by the SIGKILL two seconds later, or never: SIGTERM does not
 *    reach its group.
 * 3. A command started by that command, in a third group, outlives it.
 * 4. The groups are looked for after the first signal: by then the processes
 *    that linked them to the run are dead, the rest are reparented, and
 *    nothing ties them to the run any more.
 * 5. Over-reach: a process group that is not the run's, in the same account,
 *    is signalled too.
 * 6. Without ps (or with ps failing), nothing is signalled at all, where the
 *    run's own group still has to go.
 *
 * On win32 (audit A21, and the phase 0 run where ps was ENOENT at every stop):
 * 7. The stop ends the process Tars spawned alone, `child.kill()`, and every
 *    command under it lives on. Windows has no process groups to signal and
 *    no ps: the tree is ended from the root by taskkill /T /F
 *    (platform/kill-tree.ts), before anything under it has lost its parent.
 * 8. When taskkill cannot be run, nothing is ended, where the process Tars
 *    spawned still has to go (case 6's counterpart: the tool that finds the
 *    tree is taskkill there, not ps).
 * Cases 1 to 6 run on every platform with the same assertions. On win32 the
 * witness that the commands are out of the naive kill's reach is their
 * parentage (each under the one before it, none the root) rather than their
 * group, and ignoring SIGTERM changes nothing there: taskkill /F does not ask.
 *
 * Not constructible here, and guarded in the code instead: a descendant in
 * Tars's own group. The run leads a session of its own (detached is setsid),
 * and a process can only join a group of its own session.
