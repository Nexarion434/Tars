/**
 * The two deletes a user asks for and sees fail, while another program still
 * holds the file for a moment (an antivirus, the indexer, an editor that has
 * it open with no delete sharing, as .NET opens by default):
 * - the Memory page's delete (deleteMemoryFile), which answered "EBUSY:
 *   resource busy or locked" for a file that was free a moment later;
 * - turning the status line off (disableStatusLine), whose delete of
 *   ~/.dorothy/rate-limits.json threw out of the Settings save, so the save
 *   answered failure although the settings had been written.
 *
 * How it can fail, written before the change:
 * 1. a hold that ends inside the retry budget still fails the delete, and the
 *    user sees the error;
 * 2. the call reports success and the file is still there;
 * 3. the test proves nothing: the file was not held yet when the delete ran
 *    (each delete starts only once the holder says it holds the file, and a
 *    witness shows the plain delete refused under the same hold).
 *
 * The hold is a real handle, opened by PowerShell with FileShare.None, and
 * let go 150 ms after the delete may start: well inside the 1 s budget even
 * when the full suite loads the machine and PowerShell wakes late (500 ms
 * overran it once, the file still held at the end).
