/**
 * Tars's Hermes session, kept valid and watched (brief of 18/10).
 *
 * Measured in Hermes 0.21.5's own code (plugins/dashboard_auth/basic): the access
 * token lives 12 hours, the refresh token 30 days, and the gateway's middleware
 * refreshes a lapsed access token by itself and mints a new refresh token with
 * it, for 30 more days. A session therefore stays valid for as long as Tars asks
 * the gateway something, signed in, at least once a month; what ends it then is
 * the gateway (a new signing secret, a sign-out, another provider's rules). On
 * 17/10 every kanban call answered "Unauthorized" and nothing said so.
 *
 * How this can fail, written before the code:
 * 1. a refusal a kanban call met says nothing to the window until the next check:
 *    it must turn the state to signed out at once, and tell the window once, not
 *    at every refused call;
 * 2. the watch never asks the gateway, so nothing renews the session and nothing
 *    finds it dead: a check at start, then one every interval;
 * 3. a gateway that does not answer, or a check that throws, is reported as signed
 *    out, which tells the user to sign in when the gateway is down;
 * 4. once the user has signed in again, the window goes on saying signed out;
 * 5. an unmeasured version is not said, or a measured one is said as unmeasured,
 *    or no version at all passes as measured;
 * 6. with no Hermes configured, or one that asks for no sign-in, the watch says
 *    signed out, or asks anything at all of a gateway nobody configured;
 * 7. a refusal racing a check tells the window twice for one change;
 * 8. stop() leaves the timer running.
 * 9. one refused call (a 401 during a gateway's refresh, say) keeps the window on
 *    signed out until the next check, half an hour on, while every call after it
 *    works; or a burst of refusals asks the gateway once per refusal (the Audit's
 *    L2 on #452).
