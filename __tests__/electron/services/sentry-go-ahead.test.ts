/**
 * The user's go-ahead on a Sentry error, through the relay (DESIGN-RELAIS-HERMES-V2.md, section 3 on #242, and Noah's
 * decision 4 of 2026-10-01): the error triage files each new error as a parked task, as before, and asks the user on
 * Telegram before anybody hears of it. "oui" hands the task to the orchestrator of the Tars project, "non" archives
 * it, anything else is asked again.
 *
 * How it can fail, written before the code:
 *  1. The orchestrator hears of a new error before the user's go-ahead (#242 told it at once); or the triage files
 *     tasks while the relay is off, with nobody to ask.
 *  2. The request does not reach the user through the relay as a Sentry request of the project, with the error's
 *     short id, its title quoted as data on one line, its number of events, and the two words to reply; or it goes
 *     out twice for one error, in one poll or over polls.
 *  3. "oui" does not hand the task on: the orchestrator is not told, is told twice, or is told of another error; "Oui.",
 *     "OUI!" or "oui " is not taken for "oui".
 *  4. The orchestrator's CLI does not run, and the note is dropped (the defect #242's design found): it must wait,
 *     across a restart of Tars too, and go once the CLI runs, once.
 *  5. "non" does not archive the task on the board, archives another, or the orchestrator is told anyway; a board that
 *     refuses leaves the user believing it was archived, and a later "non" cannot try again.
 *  6. Anything else ("peut-être", "oui non", "ok", "non merci") decides something, or the user is not asked again.
 *  7. A second answer to a request already decided changes the decision (a "non" after "oui" archives a task the
 *     orchestrator may have handed on), or goes unanswered.
 *  8. The go-aheads are kept where an agent can write them (~/.dorothy), so that an agent could hand a task on in the
 *     user's name; or where others can read them.
 *  9. A request waiting for Hermes is asked again while it waits, or never again once it expired unsent; a request
 *     that could not go leaves the task parked with nobody asked.
 * 10. The user is not told what became of an answer.
 * 11. The user's "oui" covers less than the task carries (the Audit's gate of #292): a field the task quotes from the
 *     error (its culprit, a field anyone can forge with the public DSN) is not in the request, or not quoted the same
 *     way, so a forged event with a plain title hands its payload on.
 * 12. The note is marked given before the orchestrator has it (the same gate): found mid-turn, it waits in memory and
 *     a quit of Tars loses it while the list says given; it must stay owed on disk and go at the next rest, once.
 *
 * Sentry is a real HTTP server on the loopback, Hermes's board the fake of fixtures/fake-hermes.ts, the plugin a real
 * HTTP stand-in (fixtures/fake-tars-relay.ts) behind the real relay channel; the real triage is loaded again to play
 * a restart. Only the note's delivery to the orchestrator is a stand-in here: kanban-triage-note.test.ts holds
 * tellOrchestratorAsTars to its word.
