/**
 * The Chat goes back to the live conversation once the Hermes connection
 * changes.
 *
 * The overseer answers over the gateway's live session, in about nine seconds,
 * and falls back to a cron job, about thirty, when the gateway will not open
 * one. It remembers the refusal so an install with no live transport does not
 * pay for the attempt on every turn, and its own comment says the memory is
 * cleared whenever the connection settings change. Nothing ever cleared it:
 * resetLiveSession had no caller since the live session arrived (ade3eee), so
 * one refusal, an expired sign-in say, put every later turn on the slow path
 * until Tars restarted. And signing out left a socket opened under the old
 * session in use. Found in D2.
 *
 * How this can fail, written before the fix:
 * 1. saving a connection leaves the Chat on the slow path;
 * 2. signing in again leaves it there;
 * 3. importing Hermes Desktop's connection leaves it there;
 * 4. signing out leaves the socket opened before it in use, open;
 * 5. the attempt is made again on every turn, which an install with no live transport pays each time.
 *
 * The overseer and the Hermes handlers are the real ones; the live transport
 * and the gateway calls are fakes that count what is asked of them.
