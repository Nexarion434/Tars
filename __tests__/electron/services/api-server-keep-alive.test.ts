/**
 * The local API and the connections it keeps alive between two requests.
 *
 * Node's server says `Keep-Alive: timeout=5` and closes an idle connection a
 * second after that. A client closes its own end before, on a timer, but only
 * if its event loop gets to run that timer. One held by a synchronous call (the
 * ACP spec's execFileSync of PowerShell, seconds long on a loaded Windows
 * machine) or a starved process comes back after the server has closed, has
 * not read the close yet, and writes its next request onto the dead
 * connection: the server's system answers with a reset, and the caller gets
 * `fetch failed` / ECONNRESET for a request the server never saw. Measured on
 * 2026-09-26 (e2e/acp-delegation.spec.ts:142): 8 resets in 30 run-task POSTs
 * whose client was held 3.5 to 7 s, each on a connection the server had
 * destroyed in socketOnTimeout at 6.0 s of idleness.
 *
 * Every way this can fail:
 *  1. The server closes an idle kept-alive connection within seconds, so a
 *     client held past its own keep-alive timer reuses a closed connection and
 *     its next request is reset (the defect).
 *  2. The hold is lengthened by raising the timeout the server advertises:
 *     clients then keep their connections as long, and the same race moves to
 *     the new boundary. What the server says must stay `timeout=5`.
 *  3. A longer hold keeps the quit waiting on idle connections: stopping the
 *     server must still end an idle connection at once.
 *
 * Raw sockets on purpose: they have no idle timer of their own, which is
 * exactly the client whose timer did not run, and they reuse one connection
 * deterministically where fetch's pool picks among several.
