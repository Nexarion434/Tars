/**
 * Whether the last run of Tars ended abruptly, and who was working when it did (RD-REDEMARRAGE.md, 2.2; Noah's yes
 * of 2026-10-05). agents.json cannot say: it saves a working agent as idle, and a crash leaves it as the last save
 * had it. So a run marks its start, keeps the working agents' state as it changes, and marks a clean end.
 *
 * How it can fail, written before the code:
 * 1. A clean quit reads as a crash at the next launch (agents resumed after a normal quit), or a crash as clean
 *    (nobody resumed).
 * 2. The first launch ever reads as a crash, or a damaged record stops the launch or reads as one with garbage in it.
 * 3. Who was working is lost: the record keeps only idle agents, or keeps one that came to rest since; an agent
 *    mid-turn at a permission prompt or a question is not counted, or one waiting for its next prompt is.
 * 4. The crashed run's record is overwritten at launch before it is read, so a second launch reads the first as clean.
 * 5. A run that crashed again soon after resuming agents is resumed again, and again: a loop.
 * 6. The record carries more than it needs: a task's text past 200 characters.
 * 7. (the Audit's gate of #310) The record sits where an agent can write it (~/.dorothy, in every agent's --add-dir):
 *    a record an agent wrote makes Tars start, at the next launch, whatever agents it names, at-rest ones included.
