/**
 * Which agent is put to sleep: Noah's choices 5 and 6 of 2026-10-05, "an agent
 * with no turn for 30 minutes is put to sleep and woken on its own
 * conversation when it is needed; orchestrators are never put to sleep"
 * (RD-RAM.md, 2.1: 265 to 600 MB given back per agent).
 *
 * Asleep, its CLI and everything under it are ended. So the rule is about what
 * would be lost, and it refuses on any doubt.
 *
 * How it fails, written before the code:
 * 1. An orchestrator is put to sleep.
 * 2. An agent is put to sleep before 30 minutes without a turn: its status, its
 *    last turn or the last work handed to it is more recent, or the time is
 *    not known.
 * 3. An agent at work, in a dialog, in error, stopped, already asleep, with no
 *    CLI, or whose launch is on its way is put to sleep.
 * 4. An agent with something alive under its CLI other than its MCP servers (a
 *    background task, a dev server, a live caffeinate), or whose process table
 *    cannot be read, is put to sleep: what runs dies with it.
 * 5. An agent something is owed to (a held note or room message, a kanban
 *    note, an open question to the user), or that is owed news (work it handed
 *    out, background it left for its requester), is put to sleep: what is held
 *    is bound to its session and dropped with it.
 * 6. An agent whose field holds a draft, a queued write or a pause in typing is
 *    put to sleep: the draft is lost.
 * 7. An agent whose conversation cannot be resumed (no transcript, a CLI Tars
 *    cannot resume) is put to sleep: woken, it would start a new conversation.
 * 16. (QA's gate of #322) An agent waiting on its own timer (a ScheduleWakeup of
 *    /loop, a CronCreate) or on a background agent its CLI runs in-process is put
 *    to sleep: no process shows either, and both die with the CLI, silently. What
 *    its last Stop hook counted decides; a Stop hook that counted nothing (an
 *    older claude) leaves it to the transcript's background work; a count that
 *    is not one is not taken.
 * 17. (PR A, written with its code and shown to bite by a mutant) A requester whose request is still out at a
 *     worker, queued or written, is not owed anything, and is put to sleep before the answer comes.
