/**
 * A delegated run stops with its agent (the Audit's table on a3d7c125, #6).
 *
 * `AcpSession.cancel()` had no caller, and the runs delegateOverAcp starts were
 * tracked nowhere: stopping or deleting the agent ended its terminal and left
 * its ACP run working, for up to its hour, with the agent's run token. And
 * `stop()` killed the process Tars spawned (npx, the adapter) and nothing it
 * had started: the CLI underneath, and whatever command that CLI ran.
 *
 * How it fails, written before the code (2026-09-24):
 * 1. Stopping an agent leaves its delegated run working.
 * 2. The run is killed without being asked to cancel first.
 * 3. The process Tars spawned dies, and what it spawned lives on.
 * 4. The caller of the run is told nothing it can tell from a crash.
 * 5. Stopping one agent reaches another agent's run.
 * 6. A run that ended is still held, and a stop later reaches a process id
 *    that may be someone else's by then.
 * 7. The stop route of the API (what an orchestrator calls) does not reach it.
