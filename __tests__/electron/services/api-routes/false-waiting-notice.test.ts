/**
 * An orchestrator told "is now waiting" about an agent that had just started.
 *
 * Noah's report of 2026-09-18 (faux-waiting-2b86): the orchestrator of
 * 1212-Capital delegated a task to 1212-Backend and was told at once, in its
 * own terminal, that 1212-Backend "is now waiting", while it had only begun.
 * What the logs of that evening show, and what each case below replays:
 *
 * - delegate_task tries ACP first, through /run-task, which sets `running`.
 *   The ACP start failed (after 90 s in 1.7.6), /run-task put back the status
 *   the agent had before, `waiting` because idle, and agent-watch took that for
 *   a new wait. The note went to the orchestrator through the link left by a
 *   delegation of 17:30, which a normal end of turn never spends.
 * - The idle prompt is Claude Code saying the agent has sat at its prompt for
 *   sixty seconds. It lands as `waiting` whatever the agent is doing, so one
 *   raised before a task was handed over and posted after it put the working
 *   agent back to `waiting` and told the orchestrator so.
 * - A note held while the orchestrator was busy was handed over after it had
 *   given the same agent new work (09-16 23:30, the QA).
 *
 * And what must still happen: a permission prompt in the middle of a turn is
 * news, and so is the end of the work that was handed over, once.
 *
 * Everything here goes through the real routes, the real agent-watch and the
 * real agent map. The terminals are recorders: the note an orchestrator reads
 * is exactly what writeProgrammaticInput was asked to type into its terminal.

 * then sitting in that poll when the turn ends, so it is told twice: the poll
 * answers, and 375 ms later the note is typed into its terminal, which costs
 * it a whole turn to read something it already has. The QA measured 35 s of
 * one on 2026-09-20.
