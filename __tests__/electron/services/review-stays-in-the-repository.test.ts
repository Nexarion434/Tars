/**
 * The Review page reads what is in the repository, and says when a patch was cut.
 *
 * The Audit's gate of #272 (GATE-PR272.md, 01/10) found two defects older than it, both measured on main:
 * `review:file` showed a file outside the repository when the renderer named it with `../..` (the untracked fallback
 * read `path.join(repoPath, file)`), and a patch larger than git()'s 8 MB buffer came back empty, marked as not cut.
 *
 * How this can fail, written before the code:
 * 1. a path with `../..` gets a file outside the repository shown, through the fallback for untracked files;
 * 2. an absolute path does the same;
 * 3. a link inside the repository that points out has its target's content shown, or its target's lines counted in
 *    the list;
 * 4. a file reached through a linked folder inside the repository, a folder that points out, is shown;
 * 5. a patch larger than git()'s 8 MB buffer comes back empty and marked as not cut, in the list's patch; and a file's
 *    own patch that large is replaced by "file is too large to show", as if the file were untracked.
 * And what must not change: an untracked file inside the repository is shown, as before.
 *
 * Real git, real repositories and links in a temporary folder, the real reviewDiff and fileDiff.
