/**
 * Telling a running agent that is doing nothing from one that is busy
 * (PLAN-1.9.2.md item B).
 *
 * Measured on 28/09: a Claude Code 2.1.283 froze mid-turn, its main thread in
 * openat, 0 % CPU, one child a zombie nobody reaped; Tars showed it running
 * and the night was lost. Measured on 01/10 over 21 live claude processes:
 * during a turn each keeps a `caffeinate -i -t 300` child, renewed (all were
 * under 300 s old); a Bash tool runs as a `zsh -c source ...shell-snapshots...`
 * child; its MCP servers are children too (Tars's bundles, Pen's server,
 * `npm exec @sentry/mcp-server`). A frozen event loop renews nothing: the last
 * caffeinate exits unreaped, which is the zombie of 28/09.
 *
 * So: running, no write to its transcript for 30 minutes, and no tool at
 * work, meaning no live process under its CLI but its MCP servers and
 * caffeinate. A long Bash command (a build, a test run) writes nothing to the
 * transcript while it runs and is not a stall.
 *
 * How it fails, written before the code (2026-10-01):
 * 1. A long tool (a build of 40 minutes) is reported as a stall.
 * 2. A frozen CLI is missed because its MCP servers, its caffeinate or a
 *    zombie child count as work.
 * 3. A stall is reported before 30 minutes, or for an agent that is not
 *    running (waiting on a question, idle, stopped).
 * 4. An agent whose transcript cannot be found is reported: nothing is known.
 * 5. The CLI is not found under the terminal: the shell is taken for it in an
 *    interactive terminal, where claude is the shell's child, or claude is
 *    missed where the shell exec'd it.
 * 6. ps's lines are misread: a command with spaces, a zombie, the header.
 *
 * And from the Audit's gate of #283 (2026-10-01): an agent inside a long MCP
 * call (wait_for_agent, delegate_task, an hour and more) or running a
 * subagent has nothing under it but its MCP servers and caffeinate, and writes
 * nothing to its transcript, yet it works.
 * 7. A live caffeinate renewed by the event loop (not a zombie, under 300 s
 *    old) is not taken for a sign of life, and working agents read stalled.
 * 8. Over-correction: a caffeinate older than its 300 s, or a zombie one,
 *    spares a frozen CLI; with no caffeinate at all (Linux has none) nothing
 *    is ever stalled.
 * 9. ps's elapsed time is misread ([[dd-]hh:]mm:ss).
 * 10. The quit leaves the watch's timer running (main.ts's quit, after #235).
 *
 * And with the state mod (mods step 1, 2026-10-05): a session that runs it
 * sends a heartbeat from inside Claude Code's own event loop every 15 s, which
 * a frozen loop stops sending. The heartbeat replaces the rule above for that
 * session, and the rule above stays for every other one.
 * 11. A mod session whose heartbeat stopped five minutes ago, its CLI still
 *     there, is not marked; or one is marked while its heartbeat comes.
 * 12. A mod session is still judged by the transcript and caffeinate (a long
 *     silent turn marked though its heartbeat comes), or a session without
 *     the mod is judged by a heartbeat it never sends.
 * 13. A mod session is marked once its CLI is gone (the terminal closed).
