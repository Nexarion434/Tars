/**
 * The hooks of 1.7.9 and before logged to /tmp/dorothy-hooks.log and
 * /tmp/dorothy-hooks-debug.log, readable by every user of the machine. #135
 * moved the logs to ~/.dorothy/logs at 0600 and left the old files behind:
 * about 4 MB of session ids and prompt openings (the Audit, gate of #135).
 * Tars removes them once, at startup.
 *
 * How this fails, written before the code:
 * 1. The old files stay after the update.
 * 2. A link planted at one of those paths is followed, and whatever it points
 *    to is deleted with the user's rights.
 * 3. A directory, or a file another user owns, at one of those paths is
 *    removed or throws.
 * 4. A sandbox or a test run of Tars, HOME a scratch folder, deletes the logs
 *    a Tars still on 1.7.9 is writing beside it.
 * 5. Startup fails when the files are not there, which is every startup after
 *    the first.
