/**
 * Tars's side of the relay to the user's Telegram through their Hermes (DESIGN-RELAIS-HERMES-V2.md, step 2): the
 * channel itself. A send goes to the tars-relay plugin's /send on the gateway Tars already reaches; the user's replies
 * come back from its /replies, polled every 5 s while the relay is on, and are acked once taken.
 *
 * How this can fail, written before the code:
 * 1. A send does not reach the plugin, or reaches it without the dashboard's token, or other than as the caller wrote
 *    it: its text, kind and ref, and the project as the one word the plugin takes.
 * 2. The message id that came back is not in Tars's own list of what it sent; or that list is kept where agents can
 *    write it (~/.dorothy), or where others can read it (not 0600 in a 0700 folder).
 * 3. With the relay off, anything is sent, polled or acked, or a send says it went.
 * 4. With Hermes down, a send is lost, or goes another way (there is no fallback), or its caller is told it went; it
 *    does not go once Hermes answers again; it goes twice; or it still goes after its time is up.
 * 5. A reply to a message Tars did not send, an id not in its own list, is handed to anyone, or vanishes without the
 *    user being told.
 * 6. A reply is handed over twice, within a poll, across polls or after a restart; or it is never acked, and the
 *    plugin keeps it a week.
 * 7. The plugin is missing, its user id is not set on the server, the token is refused, or Hermes is down, and the
 *    status does not say which.
 * 8. A reply whose handler throws stops the ones after it, or is never acked.
 * 9. With the relay on, the event reports do not go through it, or go under no project; with it off, they still go.
 * 11. The plugin's store is made again (reinstalled, moved, cleaned) and numbers its replies from 1 again: Tars skips
 *    every reply at or below the last number it took, acks it, and the plugin deletes it, Noah told nothing
 *    (GATE-PR285.md); or Tars, starting over, hands over again a reply of the same store whose ack was lost.
 * 10. The plugin keeps "@name" for Tars only for the projects Tars registered with it (the Audit's Low on #280): the
 *    fleet's projects are not registered, and every "@project" goes to Hermes's model; a folder name that is not one
 *    word is sent, the plugin refuses the whole list, and no project can be reached; a project added to the fleet or
 *    gone from it is not told to the plugin at the next round, nor are the names again once the plugin has lost them;
 *    or they are posted at every round when nothing changed, in another case included.
 *
 * A real HTTP stand-in for the plugin's routes (fixtures/fake-tars-relay.ts), the real connection file under a
 * throwaway HOME, the real channel module, loaded again to play a restart.
