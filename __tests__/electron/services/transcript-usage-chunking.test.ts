 * What the slicing had to not break, and what a failed read must not look like.
 *
 * Pricing used to read each transcript whole and hold the main thread for 2775
 * ms over the 884 MB here. It reads four megabytes at a time now, and two of
 * the things that change with that are worth a test of their own.
 *
 * A UTF-8 character can straddle a chunk boundary. Cutting one in half
 * corrupts the line it sits in, and a corrupted line is a line that fails to
 * parse, which is to say tokens that quietly stop being billed. The decoder is
 * what prevents it, and the case below puts a four byte character exactly
 * across the boundary rather than trusting it.
 *
 * And a transcript that will not open used to come back as an empty list,
 * which is indistinguishable from one holding no usage. That turns a failure
 * into a smaller bill: the one kind of error that looks like good news, so
 * nobody reports it.
