/**
 * The window in which the Chat journal is behind memory, and what may not
 * happen inside it.
 *
 * The journal is written once per turn of the event loop now, not once per
 * delivery row, which means there is a moment when the state in memory has a
 * row the file does not. Three things would turn that moment into a lost
 * write, and this file holds each one shut:
 *
 *  - the moment lasting longer than the synchronous run it belongs to, so that
 *    a timer, a socket or an IPC callback could run while the file is behind;
 *  - anything reading the journal off disk in between, which would read the
 *    state as it was and hand it back as the truth;
 *  - a mutator that changes the state and schedules nothing, whose change then
 *    waits for somebody else's write and is lost if nobody writes.
 *
 * The first two are measured against the real store. The third is a scan of
 * the module: its floor is what a scan can see, and the lists below are what a
 * person has to keep honest, which is why adding an export fails this file
 * until it is classified.
