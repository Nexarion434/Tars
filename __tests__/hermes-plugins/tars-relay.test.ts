/**
 * The tars-relay Hermes plugin's own tests, in the regression net.
 *
 * The plugin is Python and runs inside Noah's Hermes, never in Tars. Its rules are tested by
 * hermes-plugins/tars-relay/tests (unittest, standard library only), and CI runs nothing but npm test, so this runs
 * them there.
 *
 * How this can fail, written before the code:
 * 1. Python is there under another name than python3 (python, or the py launcher on Windows) and is not found;
 * 2. something that is not a Python 3.9 or later is taken for one: an older Python, or Windows's "python" that only
 *    opens the Store;
 * 3. there is no Python and the plugin's tests are skipped without a word, or skipped on CI, where they must run;
 * 4. the tests do not run at all, and zero tests reads as a success;
 * 5. some of them stop being found, and fewer tests pass than were written;
 * 6. one of them fails.
