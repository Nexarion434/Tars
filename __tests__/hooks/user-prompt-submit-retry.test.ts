/**
 * The one post that restores a live session's ownership.
 *
 * When Tars sends a task into an already running claude, from Slack or
 * Telegram, it clears the agent's session ownership as it arms the
 * never-started-a-turn check, because that check reads "nothing has registered
 * yet". A live session never sends a second SessionStart, so the only thing
 * that gives ownership back is this hook's status post, which the server adopts
 * because it carries no `source`.
 *
 * It was one attempt, --max-time 3, no retry. Lost, and the agent is unowned
 * and then accused ten minutes later of never having started while it is
 * working: the exact error the check exists to avoid, newly created by the
 * clearing. SessionStart already retried for the same reason.
 *
 * So this runs the real script against a real server that drops the first post.
