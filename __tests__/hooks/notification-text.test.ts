/**
 * A notification reaches Tars with the words the CLI wrote, and nothing after.
 *
 * notification.sh quoted its title and message with `echo "$X" | jq -Rs .`:
 * echo ends the text with a newline and `jq -Rs` keeps it, so every
 * notification Tars received ended in a "\n" the CLI never sent. on-stop.sh
 * has always used printf. The real script runs here and posts to a local
 * server, which keeps the body it was sent.
