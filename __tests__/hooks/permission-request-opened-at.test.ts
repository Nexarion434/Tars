/**
 * permission-request.sh says when the dialog opened (the Audit's re-check of
 * #174). Tars took the post's arrival for that moment: a post a busy Tars
 * handled after the refusal made the refusal look older than the dialog, and
 * the agent stayed deaf until its next turn.
 *
 * How it fails, written before the code (2026-09-24):
 * 1. The post carries no time of its own.
 * 2. The time is taken with a BSD-only or GNU-only `date` flag, and is missing
