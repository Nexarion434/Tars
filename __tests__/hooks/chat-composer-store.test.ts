/**
 * A chat's composer, kept per chat for the whole window (src/hooks/useChatComposer.ts):
 * its words, the send on its way and what it came to. A chat's page is keyed by its
 * chat, so opening another chat unmounts the field, and a launch can take a minute
 * (git fetch, the worktree, its dependencies). The Audit's L1 on PR 392. Written
 * before the code. How it can fail:
 * 1. the words written in a chat's field are gone once its page is left;
 * 2. a send answered after its page was left is lost: a refusal says nothing when
 *    the chat is opened again, and its words are gone;
 * 3. a send still on its way is forgotten on the way back: the field is empty and
 *    open while the launch goes on, nothing says so, and the same words sent again
 *    reach the orchestrator twice;
 * 4. one chat's words, send or answer show in another chat;
 * 5. the words stay after a send that went in, or words written since the send
 *    left are cleared with them;
 * 6. a refusal, or a full limit, clears the words;
 * 7. a call that throws leaves the send on its way for ever, the field shut;
 * 8. a first message names its chat only while the page is open, names a chat its
 *    user named, or names one after a refusal; a name refused is lost;
 * 9. a held send's strip outlives the orchestrator's next turn, or that turn takes
 *    a refusal's reason away with it;
 * 10. blank words are sent;
 * 11. the page open on the chat is not told when the answer comes.
