/**
 * A hook sends its terminal's token only to the Tars that spawned its CLI
 * (the Audit's table on a3d7c125, #11).
 *
 * A hook posts to 127.0.0.1:31415 with the token of its terminal. When Tars is
 * down, or restarting, whatever holds that port gets the token: any process of
 * any account on the machine may listen there. So Tars mints an instance id
 * per run, hands it to each CLI in its environment beside the token
 * (TARS_INSTANCE_ID), and the hook first asks the port to prove it knows it:
 * it sends a fresh random challenge to /api/health, and only sends its token
 * when the answer is sha256("<instance id>:<challenge>").
 *
 * How it fails, written before the code (2026-09-24):
 * 1. Something other than Tars holds the port and answers /api/health: the
 *    token goes to it anyway.
 * 2. It answers with a proof it saw earlier, replayed: the challenge must be
 *    new each time, and an old proof refused.
 * 3. Nothing answers, or the answer never ends: the hook hangs, or sends the
 *    token blind.
 * 4. A CLI with no instance id in its environment (started outside Tars, or by
 *    a Tars from before this) sends a token it may hold to whoever answers.
 * 5. Over-correction: the Tars that spawned the CLI stops getting the token,
 *    and every status of its agents freezes.
 * 6. The instance id itself travels: in a request the hook makes, or in the
 *    server's answer, where anyone could read it and prove to be Tars later.
 * 7. (the Audit's gate of #212) The check gives up sooner than the posts do:
 *    it waited 2 s and a post waits 3 s, so a Tars whose main thread was held
 *    2.5 s (a transcript scan takes 2.7 s, the Usage page 4.15 s) lost the
 *    token, and the post was refused: a Stop lost, the agent left running.
 *    The check waits 5 s, longer than any post: held up to that, Tars still
 *    gets its token, where a post without the check would have given up.
 *
 * The real hook scripts and their helper, with only the port pointed at a
 * server here that plays Tars, or plays the squatter.
