/**
 * The session gets registered, whatever the API is doing.
 *
 * Losing the registration is the whole failure: with no session on the agent,
 * the ownership contract in hooks-routes.ts drops every status, output and
 * task-completed post it goes on to make, and the never-started watch accuses
 * it ten minutes later while it is working. The task ran; only its result was
 * lost, which from outside is indistinguishable from a lost order.
 *
 * Two ways to lose it were found, and the second was created by the fix for
 * the first:
 *
 *  - A probe with no read deadline. `--connect-timeout` bounds the TCP
 *    handshake only, so a socket that accepts and never answers left curl
 *    blocked with no deadline at all, and the hook was killed at its timeout
 *    before it could post.
 *  - The same probe with a read deadline. Bounded at 2s against an API that
 *    was alive but answering in 3s, the hook exited early and never posted:
 *    a blocked start traded for a silent one, which is worse.
 *
 * No deadline is right, because the failure is categorical rather than
 * proportional: one millisecond over and the work is skipped entirely. So the
 * probe is gone. The POST answers "is the API there?" by doing the work, and
 * the answer lands server-side the moment the request is received: curl giving
 * up on the response does not undo it.
 *
 * These run the real scripts against real servers behaving each way.
