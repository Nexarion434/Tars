/**
 * What a project's shell writes before its terminal is there to hear it
 * (src/lib/pty-backlog.ts). The Projects page asks main for a PTY, then mounts
 * <Terminal>, a dynamic import away, which only then listens to the PTY: the
 * shell's banner and first prompt, written in between, reached nobody, and the
 * terminal opened empty (the QA's WHEEL-QA.md, 05/10). The page now listens
 * before it asks, and hands the terminal what came. Written before the code.
 * How it can fail:
 * 1. a chunk the PTY writes before the page knows its id (pty:create has not
 *    answered yet) is lost: the page must listen before it asks;
 * 2. another PTY's chunks are handed over: every PTY's data comes through the
 *    one channel;
 * 3. the order is lost;
 * 4. the listening never ends: once the terminal has taken the chunks it hears
 *    the PTY itself, and a page that went on listening kept every chunk of
 *    every PTY for as long as it lived; a terminal that never came (the dialog
 *    closed first, pty:create failed) left it listening too;
 * 5. the chunks are handed over twice: React runs an effect twice in
 *    development, the terminal's subscription with it.
 *
 * Opening the PTY with its listening (openPtyHeard), the Audit's Low at the
 * gate of #328, written before the code:
 * 6. the page that asked is gone when pty:create answers (it was left while
 *    the PTY was being made): nothing would take the backlog or kill the
 *    shell, so the listening, which hears every agent's output, went on for
 *    the window's life, and the shell lived on with nobody attached. The
 *    listening ends and the PTY is killed;
 * 7. over-correction: a page still there gets its PTY, and its backlog still
 *    listens, until its terminal takes it;
 * 8. pty:create fails: the listening ends, and the failure reaches the page.
