/**
 * The line an asleep agent reads, and the one it reads while it wakes, where
 * an error gives its reason: in place of the task on its card, of the branch
 * in its pane's header, of the path in its window, under its name in an
 * orchestrator's rail. Since #322 an agent with no turn for 30 minutes is put
 * to sleep (`status: 'asleep'`, `asleepSince`), and every way it gets its CLI
 * back reads `waking: { by, via, since }` until its session is up. Frame:
 * `Agent asleep · and how it wakes` in design/tars-redesign.pen. Written
 * before the code. How the lines can fail:
 * 1. an agent that is not asleep says it is: a copy patched out of asleep by
 *    an event keeps the asleepSince it had;
 * 2. the time: one that does not parse prints "Invalid Date" or "NaN:NaN", and
 *    one of another day or year reads as today's;
 * 3. waking said of an agent already up: the copy kept `waking` after its
 *    session came up, or kept it on an agent stopped or asleep again; or not
 *    said of one a message woke, which reads running from the start, its task
 *    the message (corrected after the e2e: this list first allowed idle only);
 * 4. who woke it: an agent's or a chat's name, free text, turns the line
 *    around with a U+202E, splits it with a line break, or pushes the rest out
 *    by its length;
 * 5. how it was woken: each way has its own words, and a way a newer main
 *    sends that this page does not know still says who.
