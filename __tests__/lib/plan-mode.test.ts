/**
 * Where an agent's permission selectors offer plan (src/lib/plan-mode.ts).
 * PR B (#364) launches claude with --permission-mode plan, and the other CLIs
 * read plan as normal, the narrowest they have; the main process launches an
 * agent with no provider, or one it does not know, as claude. Frames:
 * `Permissions · plan mode · states`. Written before the code. How it can fail:
 * 1. Claude Code is refused plan, the one CLI that has it;
 * 2. a CLI that is not claude (codex, gemini, grok, opencode, amp, pi, ollama)
 *    is offered plan, which it would run as manual;
 * 3. an API-key provider (openrouter, deepseek...), whose launch passes no
 *    plan, is offered plan;
 * 4. an agent with no provider, or an id Tars does not know, both launched as
 *    claude, is refused plan;
 * 5. choosing a provider without plan while plan is chosen keeps plan;
 * 6. choosing a provider changes manual, auto or bypass, or turns plan into
 *    something other than manual;
 * 7. a dimmed plan's reason names no provider, or another one than chosen.
