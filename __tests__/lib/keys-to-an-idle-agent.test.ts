/**
 * Keys typed into an agent with no terminal (#164's Low, from the Audit's
 * gate). Since #164, looking at an idle agent opens no terminal, and
 * agent:input answers `{ success: false, error: 'PTY not found' }` for it. An
 * idle Dashboard panel, the agent dialog and the tray terminal still took keys,
 * their callers dropped that answer, and the dialog said "Connected to X" with
 * no terminal behind it. Written before the code, as the ways it can fail:
 * 1. keys main refuses go nowhere and nothing says so;
 * 2. it is said on every key, so a line of typing fills the panel with notices;
 * 3. keys that land are answered with a notice, or a refusal after keys landed
 *    is not said again;
 * 4. a send that fails outright is dropped as silently as a refusal was;
 * 5. the dialog says it is connected to an agent that has no terminal.
