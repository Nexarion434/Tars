/**
 * The line Settings shows beside "Send error reports" (2.0.4, #474's errorReports:last; frames
 * `Settings · Preferences · error reports, the last report` and the four Preferences frames).
 * Written before the code. Every way it can be wrong:
 * 1. No report kept (null): anything but "No report sent yet", such as a time or a kind made up.
 * 2. The time: "3 min ago" read as hours, a report from a minute ago said "0 min ago", one from an
 *    earlier day said in minutes or hours, yesterday's not said "yesterday at 18:02", a later day's
 *    not said in days, a time ahead of the clock (another machine's, a changed clock) said in the
 *    future or negative, an `at` that is not a date said as "NaN" or "Invalid Date".
 * 3. The kind: main's words shown raw ("agent-tool", "abrupt-end"), an uncaught error said "error",
 *    a kind main may add later dropped or shown as undefined.
 * 4. Sentry's answer: status 0 (none came) said "Sentry answered 0", a refusal (429) said as taken.
 * 5. The line naming anything of what the report carried: it has when, which kind, and the status.
