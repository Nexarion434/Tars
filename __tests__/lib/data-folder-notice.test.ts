/**
 * What the data folder notice says (2.0.4, the window's part of #473's app:dataDir; frame `Data folder · notice`).
 * Written before the code. Every way it can be wrong:
 * 1. A start that needs no notice shows one: moved, already, none, a did main may add later, no answer at all.
 * 2. Two data folders: main's notice not said, or said with the home folder spelled out where the frame writes ~,
 *    a path outside the home folder changed, or the notice made up when main gave none.
 * 3. A move refused: the folder Tars goes on from or the one it would move to named wrong (a Windows path read with
 *    the wrong separator), or the move said to have happened.
 * 4. A notice that is not a string (an older main) breaking the line.
