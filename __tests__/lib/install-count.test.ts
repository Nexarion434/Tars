/**
 * How many times a skill was installed, as the Extensions page writes it
 * (src/lib/install-count.ts), the way the frame `Extensions · Skills` writes
 * it: one decimal always, in K or M ("3.0M", "27.9K", "2.0K"). Written before
 * the code. How it can fail:
 * 1. a count on a round thousand loses its decimal while the next one keeps
 *    its own: "1113K" beside "1300.1K", as the page read on 12/10;
 * 2. a count of a million or more reads in thousands: "1300.1K", "3731.1K";
 * 3. rounding carries a count past its unit and leaves it there: 999,950 read
 *    "1000K" rather than "1.0M";
 * 4. a count under a thousand gains a unit or a decimal: 940 read "0.9K" or
 *    "940.0";
 * 5. a count the page cannot vouch for (none, not a number, not finite,
 *    negative, from a listing kept in a folder every agent can write) prints
 *    "NaN", "Infinity" or "-1", where the listing's own text is there to show;
 * 6. the built-in list, which carries a text and no count, loses its text.
