/**
 * When a snooze of the chat list ends, and how a snoozed row says it
 * (src/lib/chat-snooze.ts). Frame: `Shell · chats · a chat's actions ·
 * states` (For an hour, Until tomorrow, 9:00, Until Monday, 9:00; "until 9:00"
 * on the row). Written before the code. How it can fail, in local time (the
 * dates below are built in the zone the test runs in, as the window's are):
 * 1. "for an hour" is not an hour from now;
 * 2. "until tomorrow" lands today, or at another hour than 9:00, or at 9:00
 *    in another zone than the person's;
 * 3. "until Monday" on a Monday lands the same day; on a Sunday it skips a
 *    week; on a Saturday it lands on Sunday;
 * 4. a snoozed row's label gives no time, or a day when the snooze ends today,
 *    or no day when it ends another day;
 * 5. a snooze with no date, or one that does not parse, reads as a time.
