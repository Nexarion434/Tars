/**
 * The version Settings prints for a CLI, out of whatever its `--version` answers (the QA's Low on #460: the list
 * read "codex codex-cli 0.163.0"). Settings prints the command, then this: `codex 0.163.0`.
 *
 * Written before src/lib/cli-version.ts. The ways it can fail:
 * 1. A version that names its CLI first (`codex-cli 0.163.0`) is printed whole after the command.
 * 2. A note after the version is read as part of it: `2.1.258 (Claude Code)`, and Amp's `(released ..., 1h ago)`,
 *    which made a column headed version read `1h ago`, then `2h ago`.
 * 3. An answer of several lines (a banner, then the version) is read whole, or the banner taken for the version.
 * 4. An answer with no version in it (`command not found`, an error, nothing) is read as one, and the CLI as ready.
 * 5. A name holding a digit or a dash before the number (`python3 3.12.1`, `gemini-cli v0.9.0`) is cut in the wrong
 *    place.
 * 6. A version written with its v (`v0.9.0`) loses the v or its number.
 * 7. A note in the middle of the line is cut: only a note at the very end is dropped, and only if a version is left.
