/**
 * What Review's left column says of every project and every repository (2.0.4, the window's part of #472; frames
 * `Review · projects and their repositories`, `· search`, `· states`). Written before the code. Every way it can be
 * wrong:
 * 1. The projects: one added in Tars or worked in by an agent left out, one listed twice (an agent's and the list's,
 *    or a trailing separator), a folder Claude Code merely ran in listed, an agent with no project counted, an order
 *    that moves between two reads.
 * 2. A repository's name: its whole path where the path inside its project is meant, a Windows path read wrong, the
 *    project itself named by an empty string, a worktree outside the project named by a path that leads up.
 * 3. Search results: a repository listed when only its files matched, a file named without its repository, a result
 *    moved out of the order main gave, a project named by its path.
 * 4. Nothing found: a sentence with "1 repositories" or "your 1 projects", or that hides the word looked for.
 * 5. A scan still running: a count of folders or repositories left out, or the folder named by its whole home path.
