/**
 * The Chat's room list, read from the bus by useBusRooms through retryingRead.
 *
 * The list was read once, given 10 s, and on a slow start that read ran out:
 * the page put "The bus did not answer, so this list is not the whole truth.
 * bus:listRooms, no answer in 10 s" where the rows would be, and read the list
 * again only on the next bus:message or a click on retry. The answer that came
 * at 12 s was thrown away. A person saw an empty Chat, and a slow CI
 * runner met it too. Written before the code, as the ways the read can fail:
 *
 * 1. An answer that comes after the 10 s is thrown away, and the list stays
 *    empty behind the note, though the bus did answer.
 * 2. A read that failed (the call refused, or an answer that says it failed) is
 *    not read again without a click or a message.
 * 3. It asks for ever: a bus that keeps failing is asked without end, rather
 *    than three more times, the last about 30 s after the first failure.
 * 4. It stacks reads: a try, a message's refresh or a click while a read is out
 *    sends a second one beside it, and a stale answer can land last.
 * 5. A refresh asked for while a read is out is lost, so a room that appeared
 *    with its first message stays missing.
 * 6. A read that does not answer in 10 s says nothing, and the list looks like
 *    a fleet that has not spoken yet (the note must stay).
 * 7. An answer does not end the tries: once the rooms are listed, a try still
 *    pending goes out anyway. And a read asked for (a message, a click) does not
 *    replace the try that was pending, so two go out.
 * 8. It carries on once the page is gone: a try or a late answer after unmount.
