/**
 * The banner above an agent's terminal (design PR #451, on #453's contract): who gave the task in hand,
 * since when and for how long, its first line, and who gave the tasks that wait.
 *
 * Written before src/lib/task-banner.ts. The ways it can fail:
 * 1. A sender's name or a task's first line is free text (a task typed by anyone who can delegate):
 *    a line break, a right-to-left override or a zero-width character in it breaks or turns the line
 *    around on screen, as the QA measured on the message notice.
 * 2. A long name pushes the rest of the banner out of the pane; a cap that counts UTF-16 units cuts an
 *    emoji in half and draws a replacement character.
 * 3. The elapsed time reads "0 min" for a task that just began, "65 min" past an hour, or a negative
 *    duration when the main process's clock is a little ahead of the window's.
 * 4. A start time that does not parse draws "NaN min".
 * 5. The waiting tasks' senders repeat a name once per task ("Tars, Tars, Telegram"), or lose their order.
 * 6. Past two senders, the line grows with every task instead of saying how many more.
