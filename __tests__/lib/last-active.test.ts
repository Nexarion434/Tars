/**
 * lastActiveLabel (src/lib/last-active.ts): when a project or a session was
 * last active, as the Projects page writes it. Written before the code. A
 * custom project Claude Code has not run in has no date: projects.json keeps
 * bare paths, fs:list-projects sends none, and the page built `new Date('')`,
 * which every card printed as "Invalid Date" (the e2e reference projects.png
 * shows it). How it can fail:
 * 1. a date that could not be read (an empty string, a missing one, an invalid
 *    Date, NaN) prints "Invalid Date" or "NaNd ago" where nothing is known;
 * 2. moving the formatting out of the page changes what a known date prints:
 *    Today, Yesterday, so many days ago within a week, then the month and day.
