/**
 * stopLine (src/lib/stop-line.ts): the one sentence that says who stopped an
 * agent, when and why, wherever the agent is drawn. Frame: `Agent stopped ·
 * who and why` in design/tars-redesign.pen. Written before the code. How it
 * can fail:
 * 1. a line for an agent that is not stopped, from fields a stop left behind;
 * 2. the caller, the time or the reason lost on the way;
 * 3. a stop with no reason reads with a dangling colon, or says "undefined";
 * 4. a stop from another day reads as today's, or one from another year as
 *    this year's;
 * 5. a missing or broken stoppedAt, or a missing stoppedBy, prints
 *    "Invalid Date", "NaN" or "undefined";
 * 6. a name or a reason holding a character that hides or rearranges text
 *    (U+202E, a zero-width space, a line break) turns the sentence around or
 *    splits it: the name is any agent's, as its owner typed it;
 * 7. a name long enough to push the reason out of the line is drawn whole, or
 *    cut through a character;
 * 8. a reason of spaces reads as a reason.
