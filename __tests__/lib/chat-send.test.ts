/**
 * What a chat's page makes of a send (src/lib/chat-send.ts): chat:send's
 * answer (PR D), read for the page; the strip across the composer while a
 * message is on its way and after it; whether the words leave the field; and
 * "N of M working" above the list, from system:chatLimit. Frames: `Chat ·
 * chats · the composer, sending`, `· every slot working` and `· a new chat,
 * its first message`, in chat-redesign-a.pen. Written before the code. How it
 * can fail:
 * 1. an error answer is read as sent: the words leave the field and nothing
 *    says why;
 * 2. chat_limit is read as any refusal, and who works, with a Stop for each,
 *    is lost;
 * 3. a refusal's own reason is replaced by a sentence of the page's;
 * 4. an answer the page cannot read, or a call that threw, is read as sent;
 * 5. a held send is read as an error, or as nothing;
 * 6. the words are cleared after a refusal, or kept after a send that went in;
 * 7. while the orchestrator works nothing says the words wait for its turn, or
 *    a strip says so while it does not work;
 * 8. while sending, a launch says nothing (a new chat's runner takes seconds),
 *    or a send typed at once flashes a strip;
 * 9. N of M working shows before the limit is read, or its square runs at 0;
 * 10. a new chat's first message names it with more than one line, past the
 *     record's 80 characters, with its runs of spaces, or names it from
 *     nothing but spaces;
 * 11. a refusal whose reason is blank is shown with no reason, or a blank
 *     limit's sentence draws a block that says nothing (the Audit's G3 on PR
 *     392, written after the code, which already gives it the unread sentence:
 *     this case kills the mutant that drops that check).
