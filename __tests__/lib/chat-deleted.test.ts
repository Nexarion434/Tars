/**
 * What the chat list says once a chat is deleted (src/lib/chat-deleted.ts), from
 * chat:delete's answer: savedTo, the wip/ branch its runner's uncommitted work was
 * saved on, and worktreeKept, why its runner's worktree stays on disk, and where.
 * Frame: `Shell · chats · a chat's actions · states`, DELETED: WHAT STAYS, AND
 * WHERE, in tars-redesign.pen. The Audit's read of the bullets of PR 392. Written
 * before the code. How it can fail:
 * 1. a worktree kept says nothing: the chat goes and its folder stays on disk in
 *    silence;
 * 2. where it stays, or why, is lost: the main process's sentence cut or replaced;
 * 3. the branch the work was saved on is not named;
 * 4. both stay, and only one is said;
 * 5. a deletion where nothing stays says something, on every delete;
 * 6. a refusal reads as a deletion;
 * 7. an answer it cannot read (a field that is not text, or blank) says "kept:"
 *    with nothing after, or "undefined";
 * 8. it names another chat than the one deleted;
 * 9. a sentence that ends with a full stop gets a second one, the chat's own
 *    title included (a first message names a chat "Write the docs.").
 *
 * Added with the Agents page (2.0.1), before its code: agent:remove answers the
 * same two fields, and the page says them as the chat list does. How it can fail:
 * 10. an agent deleted is named otherwise than by its name, or its notice reads
 *     otherwise than a chat's for the same answer;
 * 11. an agent whose deletion failed, or of which nothing stays, says something.
