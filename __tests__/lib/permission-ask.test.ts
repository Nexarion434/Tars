/**
 * The line a permission question reads in, wherever Tars shows it: a panel's
 * line under its header, the top of the agent window's terminal column, the
 * card's task line. Since #318, a Claude agent that runs the state mod asks
 * Tars, not its terminal, before a call Claude Code would put to its dialog:
 * the agent reads `waiting` with `permissionAsk` set, and `waitingOn` names
 * what the call acts on. Frame: `Permission asked of Tars` in
 * design/tars-redesign.pen. Written before the code. How the line can fail:
 * 1. an agent that no longer waits keeps the question on the page's copy: an
 *    event patches the status alone (useElectronAgents), so an agent allowed
 *    and running again still carries the permissionAsk it had, and the line
 *    offered allow for a call already decided;
 * 2. a waiting agent with no permissionAsk is at its terminal's dialog (an
 *    older claude, a mod that did not load, a question handed back): the line
 *    offered answers Tars cannot give;
 * 3. the subject repeats the tool: waitingOn names a file as "Edit /path"
 *    (electron/utils/waiting-on.ts), and the line read "Asks to use Edit:
 *    Edit /path";
 * 4. nothing to name: no waitingOn (main hides it once an interrupt is
 *    recorded after the question), or one that only repeats the tool (an MCP
 *    tool with no field to name): the line ended on a colon, or named the
 *    tool twice;
 * 5. a character that hides or rearranges text, or breaks the line, in the
 *    tool or the subject, which an agent chose: a U+202E turned the sentence
 *    around, a line separator split the row. Main flattens the subject; the
 *    line flattens both again, as stop-line does a name;
 * 6. the time: an askedAt that does not parse printed "Invalid Date" or
 *    "NaN:NaN", and a question asked another day read as today's;
 * 7. the subject cut: waitingOn's text is cut at 200 characters, and hidden
 *    once an interrupt is recorded, where the question carries its subject
 *    whole (#318's gate, Medium 2): what is allowed must be what was read.
 *    Since #318's contract was filled the line reads `permissionAsk.subject`
 *    alone (the cases above moved to it with this one, after the code).
 * 8. why Claude Code asks is lost: the question carries its reason and the
 *    settings rule that asked (#318), and in bypass an ask rule of the
 *    person's is the only reason a call comes to Tars at all (the Audit's
 *    Low at the recheck of #318 and #320); the line dropped both;
 * 9. a reason or a rule that hides, turns or breaks the text: the agent's
 *    own shell holds the hook token and can ask with any reason, which main
 *    keeps raw (up to 1,000 characters): each is flattened as the subject
 *    is, and kept whole;
 * 10. a reason or a rule that is not given, or blank, reads as an empty
 *     row: it is '' instead, and nothing is shown for it.
