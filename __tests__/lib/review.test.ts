/**
 * What the Review page lists and how it says a patch is cut, worked out apart
 * from the page (src/lib/review.ts). The page itself is driven in
 * __tests__/components/review-page.test.tsx. Written before the code, as the
 * ways it can fail:
 * 1. a project added in Tars that no agent works in is missing from the
 *    list; or it is listed while an agent works in it, or listed without
 *    saying no agent; or a folder Claude Code merely ran in floods the list;
 * 3. a patch past 4000 lines is cut without a word, or a patch that fits
 *    says it was cut, or the count is wrong. Since the page reads a tree's
 *    files without their patches (#247), only a picked file's patch is shown,
 *    and the note carries no hint to pick one.
 * (The numbers follow the page's test, where 2, 4 and 5 live.)
