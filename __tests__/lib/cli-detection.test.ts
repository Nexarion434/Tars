/**
 * The window's copy of main's one detection of the CLIs (cliPaths:detect), which CLI Paths and Providers read
 * (useCliDetection). Written before the code. Every way it can be wrong:
 * 1. A page opened after another has the answer starts empty, so it says "looking" and shows no path until its own
 *    ask returns: CLI Paths opened again after Providers had Claude Code without a path where Providers said ready
 *    (the QA's train 3 of 2.0.4).
 * 2. Pages opened together each ask main: two asks where one answer serves both.
 * 3. A page opened later trusts the copy and never asks main again, so a path saved since in CLI Paths, which main
 *    detects anew, never reaches it.
 * 4. A refresh (detect now) loses to an older ask that answers after it, and the page shows the older answer, or the
 *    page that made the older ask is handed that older answer, which it shows last.
 * 5. A failed ask blanks a known answer, every CLI then "not found"; or, with no answer yet, never settles.
