/**
 * The word an agent's card, its detail panel and its window's header write for its provider (2.0.4, #462). The
 * frames write it as a plain lowercase word: "claude · fable 5 · main", "codex · gpt-5.3 · feat/backend".
 *
 * Written before the code. The ways it can fail:
 * 1. Qwen Code's agents read as the raw id `qwen-code`, a word no reader knows: the card did, and the E2E of
 *    #462 went red on it (18/10 20:46).
 * 2. Qwen Code reads as the Qwen API's `qwen`, so the two cannot be told apart on a card.
 * 3. The frames' plain words are lost: claude, codex, gemini and the rest turn into labels the frames do not write.
 * 4. An agent with no provider (Claude's, as every agent from before providers) reads as nothing.
 * 5. An id the window does not know yet, from a provider added later, reads as nothing or throws.
