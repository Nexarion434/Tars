/**
 * What Settings, Hermes, Gateways says of each gateway (2.0.4, the window of #469; frames `Gateways · Settings,
 * Hermes` and `· states`). Written before the code. Every way it can be wrong:
 * 1. A gateway's caption: its name not in capitals, or its id and route not the gateway's own.
 * 2. No connection info yet: an address made up from nothing.
 * 3. Tailscale serves Tars: the tailnet address not https, not on the tailnet's name, or another gateway's route.
 * 4. Tailscale running without serve, installed but stopped, or absent, or serve on with no tailnet name: a tailnet
 *    address shown that no Hermes elsewhere can reach, or a line that does not say which.
 * 5. The address on this machine: a port other than the one main answers, or another gateway's route.
 * 6. The projects a gateway reaches: a project Tars lists named otherwise than Tars names it; one Tars no longer lists
 *    lost from the chips or from the pick list (it could not be unticked then); a path with a trailing slash taken
 *    for another project; one allowed twice shown twice; so many that their chips run out of the row instead of the
 *    first ones and how many more.
 * 7. The Projects row: a gateway reaching nothing not said in the waiting tone, or one reaching some said to reach none.
 * 8. A refused save: a folder Tars may not write said as main's raw error, another reason lost, or no reason at all
 *    read as a save that went through.
