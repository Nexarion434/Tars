/**
 * What Settings, System says of the folders no agent owns, and of the disk
 * (src/lib/orphan-folders.ts), on #334's contract. Frames: `Settings · System
 * · folders no agent owns` and its states. Written before the code. How it can
 * fail:
 * 1. a size reads wrong: a folder under a megabyte as "0 MB", a total past a
 *    gigabyte in MB, the totals without the frame's one decimal ("11.0 GB"),
 *    the disk with one ("81 GB" in the frame);
 * 2. one folder reads as many: "1 folders", "remove 1 folders";
 * 3. a folder is named by its absolute path, the home in it, where the frame
 *    names it by its project and its place under .worktrees; a project
 *    Windows wrote too, whose separator is `\` (the same for 9);
 * 4. a name hides, turns or breaks the line: a folder under .worktrees is
 *    named by whatever made it, an agent among them;
 * 5. a last change that is unknown or does not parse reads "NaN months", and
 *    one month reads "1 months";
 * 6. the end of a removal that removed nothing reads "Removed 0 folders", and
 *    one that kept folders does not say why they stay;
 * 7. the disk below Tars's floor reads like any other;
 * 8. a folder main did not remove reads as one it failed to: since #334's
 *    4e939d5c it also declines one that holds a repository or a live worktree
 *    by the time it comes to it, and its row's title says which (written
 *    before the change of the sentence);
 * 9. a project git could not list reads as one with no orphan: since #334's
 *    d1cc80a8 main names it in unreadProjects and offers none of its folders,
 *    and the row still says every folder belongs to a worktree git knows, or
 *    says nothing of it beside the folders offered; it is named by its path,
 *    the home in it, where the rows name a project by its folder's name; a
 *    name hides, turns or breaks the line; two projects read as one ("its
 *    folders"). Git's reason stays in main's log: main does not send it;
 * 10. a folder the confirm named that main kept because it was no longer one
 *    no agent owns when its turn came (since #334's 9db11f16 main removes
 *    only the paths the window showed, and keeps one gone by hand or a
 *    worktree again) has no row once the list is read again, and the end
 *    says its row says why, or counts it among the folders kept for a
 *    reason the rows give.
