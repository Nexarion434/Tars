/**
 * The CLIs an E2E sandbox sees, and what it inherits from whoever runs the suite.
 *
 * The app finds each CLI on its PATH (cliPaths:detect, shell:version), and the
 * PATH launchSandboxed handed it was the caller's. On 2026-10-18 a codex was
 * installed in ~/.local/bin, and two surfaces went red on main at once
 * (settings-ai-providers, overlay-new-agent): the sandbox showed this Mac's
 * CLIs, and its claude, qwen and amp had been there all along.
 *
 * How it can fail, written on 2026-10-19 before the code:
 * 1. A folder of the account's home stays on the PATH the app is handed
 *    (~/.local/bin, nvm's, npm's, pnpm's), and the machine's CLIs with it.
 * 2. The sandbox's own CLIs are not first on it, or one of the four is missing:
 *    claude, codex, qwen and amp, the set the settings-ai-providers reference
 *    shows ready.
 * 3. A stand-in does not answer the app's probes as the real CLI does in an
 *    empty home: `--version` one line and exit 0, `claude auth status` JSON
 *    with loggedIn false and exit 1 (claude 2.1.303, measured).
 * 4. A stand-in started as an agent's CLI exits instead of drawing its screen
 *    and holding its terminal, as fake-cli.cjs does.
 * 5. The node running the suite is not on that PATH, with its npm and npx;
 *    or it is there as a link into the account's home, which a removal of the
 *    sandbox reads as a write there (home-isolation.ts refused it).
 * 6. The app inherits what Tars puts in its agents' terminals, where QA and the
 *    agents run the suite (TARS_CLAUDE_ACCOUNT, TARS_INSTANCE_ID,
 *    TARS_CHATS_READ), beside the CLAUDE, DOROTHY and ANTHROPIC families it was
 *    already kept from.
