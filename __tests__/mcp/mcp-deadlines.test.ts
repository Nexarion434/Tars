/**
 * The MCP servers that had no deadline at all: a host that stops answering
 * left the tool waiting until Claude Code gave up on the call, about half an
 * hour later, with nothing said to the agent (QA's gate of #207). mcp-vault
 * calls Tars; mcp-socialdata and mcp-x call their APIs. mcp-telegram's two
 * requests are proven elsewhere, since its tools live in its index.ts, which
 * starts the server as it loads: by the contract (__tests__/mcp/contracts),
 * and by telegram-upload-deadline.test.ts, which loads it with a fake SDK.
 *
 * How this can fail, written before the code:
 * 1. the request sets no deadline, so a silent host is waited on for ever;
 * 2. the deadline passes and the request goes on;
 * 3. it ends without saying how long it waited, in the words every server here
 *    shares ("no answer within N s", noAnswerWithin in mcp-shared), or without
 *    the server's own words for the host that did not answer;
 * 4. the deadline is out of proportion: over two minutes, which is no deadline
 *    to an agent waiting on a tool, or under ten seconds, which cuts off an
 *    answer that is only slow.
 *
 * The transport is replaced and nothing else, as in kanban-api-timeout.test.ts:
 * the real clients build their requests, and these read the deadline each one
 * set and what it does when that deadline passes. Nothing leaves the process.
