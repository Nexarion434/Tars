/**
 * An orchestrator may start again an agent Noah stopped (Noah, 05/10), and is
 * then told who stopped it and why; the restart is noted on the agent.
 * /dispatch answers `restartedAfterStop` when the start undid a stop.
 *
 * How it fails:
 * 1. start_agent answers "Started" and the orchestrator never learns the
 *    agent had been stopped, by whom, or why.
 * 2. send_message, which starts a stopped agent too, says nothing either.
 * 3. A start that undid no stop carries a note about one.
 * And from the Audit's gate of #312 (Info): the reason and the name are
 * another agent's or the user's words, put into the tool result as they were.
 * 4. They are not quoted as data, as the other tool texts quote what others
 *    wrote; or a stop from the window, filed as "you", reads to the
 *    orchestrator as its own.
 *
 * The real tools, loaded as the server loads them; only the API is replaced.
