/**
 * ask_user: the tool an agent asks the user with, on their Telegram (step 2 of the
 * relay plan). It posts through Tars (`/api/user/ask`), which decides who is
 * asking from the agent's own token, sends the question and types the answer
 * back into the agent's terminal.
 *
 * The tool is the real one, on a fake server that validates the arguments with
 * the tool's own schema (orchestrator-send-discord.test.ts does the same).
 *
 * How it fails, written before the code (2026-09-28):
 * 1. It posts anywhere but /api/user/ask, or not the question and context.
 * 2. It answers as if the user had answered: the agent must be told their answer
 *    comes later, typed into its terminal after "Message from the user via
 *    Telegram:", and nothing else carries it.
 * 3. A refusal of Tars's (a question already open, the day's limit, no
 *    Telegram) is not said in Tars's words.
 * 4. It takes a call with no question.
 * 5. (the relay, 2026-10-01) A question that waits for Hermes is answered as if it had been asked: the agent must be
 *    told it has not reached the user yet, and goes when Hermes takes it.
 * 6. (Noah's rule of 2026-10-01) Its description lets a worker think it may ask the user: only a project's
 *    orchestrator does, through the user's Hermes.
