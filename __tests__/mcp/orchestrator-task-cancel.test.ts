/**
 * task_cancel, the orchestrator MCP's way to take back work asked of another
 * agent before it went in (POST /api/tasks/:ref/cancel; core/task-cancel.ts;
 * PR D of 2.0.0). Written with its code, and shown to bite by mutants.
 *
 * How it fails:
 * 1. The id or the reason does not reach the route, or the reason is sent
 *    empty when none was given (the route then reads "a reason" where there
 *    is none).
 * 2. A refusal reaches the agent as a bare code ("not_your_task") or as a
 *    tool failure, instead of a sentence saying why and what it may do.
 * 3. A failure the route did not decide (Tars down) is passed off as a refusal.
 *
 * The real tool, loaded as the server loads it; only the API is replaced.
