/**
 * What a test cannot hold on Windows, named once, with the reason it prints.
 *
 * The same shape as symlink-privilege.ts: a function for `skipIf`, or for a
 * guard around one assertion, that answers where the platform lacks the thing
 * and says why, once per file, the first time it does. Each of these still
 * runs on macOS, Linux and CI's ubuntu, where the thing exists.
 *
 * - The `.sh` hooks and the bash status line: Windows ships neither (decision
 *   D1, WINDOWS-PORT.md). The CLIs there run the Node runner
 *   (hooks/tars-hook.mjs, hooks/statusline.mjs), held by node-hook-*.test.ts
 *   and node-statusline.test.ts. A test whose subject is a `.sh` script run by
 *   bash has nothing to run there.
 * - POSIX permission bits: Windows has none. chmod sets or clears the
 *   read-only attribute and stat reports 0o666 or 0o444 whatever was asked
 *   (audit B/S-01, SECURITY.md section 7). Only the assertion on the bits is
 *   skipped; the rest of its test runs.
