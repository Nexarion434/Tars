/**
 * Every test file writes its temporary folders into a folder of its own, which
 * goes when the file ends, and the run fails if anything is left behind.
 *
 * Measured on 2026-10-01, main at 105d22ed: one full run left 312 entries
 * (24 MB) in the temporary folder, under 96 prefixes from about 90 test files
 * and fixtures (fake-gh.ts, fake-claude.ts, worktree.test.ts, release.test.ts
 * first). The Mac had crashed that night on a full disk, and its temporary
 * folder held about a hundred of each from the day's runs. Asking each file to
 * remove what it makes is how the class reached 96 members, so
 * tmpdir-isolation.ts does it for every file, as home-isolation.ts does for HOME.
 *
 * How it can fail, each written down before the setup was:
 * 1. os.tmpdir() inside a test is still the machine's temporary folder, so
 *    whatever a test forgets to remove stays there.
 * 2. A child process the test starts without its own environment writes into
 *    the machine's folder, because the folder was moved for this process only.
 * 3. On Windows os.tmpdir() reads TEMP and TMP, not TMPDIR, so moving TMPDIR
 *    alone moves nothing there.
 * 4. The file's folder is not inside the run's own folder, so the guard at the
 *    end of the run (tmpdir-run.ts) never sees what a file leaves.
 * 5. The file's folder outlives the file. Not seen from inside the file itself:
 *    the guard fails the run when such a folder is left at its end (7 shows it
 *    on a run of its own), and the PR's witness is the run with the removal
 *    taken out (it fails).
 *
 * Written on 2026-10-05, before the fix, after CI failed on this PR's head:
 * "306 passed | 1 skipped", then "The run left 1 entry", exit 1.
 * 6. A file skipped whole runs no hooks: vitest skips its beforeAll and
 *    afterAll with its tests, whether a skipIf skipped them
 *    (real-claude-bypass.test.ts on a runner without claude, as on CI) or a -t
 *    filter matched none of them. Its folder stays, with its throwaway HOME and
 *    whatever it wrote at import (real-target.test.ts writes five files at
 *    import), and the guard fails the run on it, although nothing escaped: the
 *    run removes its own folder either way.
 * 7. The guard no longer bites: the run passes with a file's folder whose hooks
 *    ran and which outlived them, or with something written past every file's
 *    folder.
 * 8. The guard cannot tell a file that ran its hooks from one that ran none:
 *    the mark the setup leaves in a file's folder when its hooks run is missing.
