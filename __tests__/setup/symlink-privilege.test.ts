/**
 * The witness for symlink-privilege.ts, which decides whether the tests that
 * plant a symbolic link run or skip.
 *
 * How it can fail:
 *  1. it says no where a link can be made, and hides tests that would run
 *     (macOS, Linux, CI windows-latest): a regression net with holes nobody sees;
 *  2. it says yes where a link cannot be made, and those tests fail on EPERM
 *     instead of on what they assert;
 *  3. it swallows an error that is not the missing privilege, and skips for a
 *     reason it did not check;
 *  4. its two answers disagree.
