/**
 * The run's own temporary folder, and the guard that it is empty at the end.
 *
 * vitest runs this once, in its main process, before it starts the workers, so
 * the workers and everything they start inherit the folder through TMPDIR,
 * TMP and TEMP. Each test file then makes its own folder inside it and removes
 * it when it ends (tmpdir-isolation.ts). At the end of the run, anything still
 * in the folder is a file's folder that outlived the file, or something written
 * past the file's own folder, and the run fails with its names. It is removed
 * either way, so that a failed run does not leave its leftovers behind as well.
 *
 * One kind of entry is not a leak: the folder of a file skipped whole, which
 * ran no hooks and so could not remove it. It is the one file folder without
 * the mark tmpdir-isolation.ts leaves when a file's hooks run, and the run
 * removes it with its own.
 *
 * Why the run fails rather than warns: 312 entries a run were left on
 * 2026-10-01, a day of that filled a disk, and no one had read a warning.
