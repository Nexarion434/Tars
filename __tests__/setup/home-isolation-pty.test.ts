/**
 * A terminal spawned in-process still works under home-isolation.ts's guard.
 *
 * Found by win-platform on 2026-09-25: node-pty on Windows opens the ConPTY
 * input pipe with fs.openSync(conin, 'w'), which the guard wraps. The guard
 * resolved the target with realpathSync.native first, and resolving a named
 * pipe (\\.\pipe\...) opens it, taking its only connection: node-pty's own
 * open then failed with EBUSY, in every test that spawns a pty under the
 * guard. A pipe is not a file under any home, and is not resolved.
 *
 * Not mocked, unlike the other files here: the real node-pty, the real guard.
