/**
 * The ambient environment does not reach the suite.
 *
 * Twice in one night a test's verdict turned out to depend on who ran it.
 * `managed-cli-env` asserts that Tars does NOT put DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER on a
 * codex spawn; the spawn spreads `process.env`, which is right for a pty, so
 * "Tars did not add this" and "this is not present" are different statements
 * and only the first is the property. Tars has run its own agents with that
 * variable set since 1.7.0, so the suite was green in CI and red in every
 * terminal Tars had started - including the one an agent runs the suite in.
 * DISABLE_UPDATES was the same defect one variable over, and would have hit any
 * developer on an IT-managed laptop. `constants.test.ts` has the mirror image:
 * it asserts API_PORT is 31415, which `scripts/sandbox.sh` falsifies by
 * exporting DOROTHY_API_PORT=31499 into the shell you then run tests from.
 *
 * Two occurrences on one cause is a class, so this removes the cause instead of
 * the symptoms. Isolating a variable at a time was the alternative, and it only
 * works for the ones somebody has already been bitten by.
 *
 * This runs as a setupFile, which vitest loads BEFORE the test file's imports.
 * That ordering is the whole point and not an incidental: `constants.ts` reads
 * DOROTHY_API_PORT at module load, so a cleanup in a beforeEach would run after
 * the value had already been baked into an exported constant.
 *
 * A test that WANTS one of these sets it itself, and still can: nothing here
 * runs again after this point, so an assignment inside a test or a beforeEach
 * survives untouched.
