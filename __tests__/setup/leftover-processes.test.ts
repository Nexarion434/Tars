/**
 * The witness for leftover-processes.ts, which the ACP tests end their
 * leftover processes through.
 *
 * How it can fail:
 *  1. a process the test saw, still running, is left running;
 *  2. win32: a process that holds an id only since the test saw it, which
 *     Windows handed out again once the one the test meant had exited, is
 *     ended: any process of the machine, a vitest worker included;
 *  3. an id that is not a positive integer is signalled: 0 is the caller's
 *     own process on Windows and its whole process group elsewhere, -1 every
 *     process the account may signal.
 *
 * Written on 2026-10-19, before the code, after 130 fake ACP agents were found
 * stopped (state T, parent 1), all started from
 * /T/tars-vitest-run-<id>/tars-vitest-file-<id>/tars-acp-<id>/, and ended by
 * hand. A delegated run's stop (endProcessTree in acp/client.ts) stops the
 * run's processes with SIGSTOP and reads ps before it sends SIGTERM and
 * SIGCONT; the test does not wait for it, and a worker that ends in between
 * leaves them stopped for good. What a test starts by way of the code under
 * test, the test ends in its own teardown, and what still runs from the run's
 * folder at its end fails the run (tmpdir-run.ts). The ways that can fail:
 *  4. a process started from the folder and stopped by SIGSTOP is missed, or
 *     found and left alive: a SIGTERM waits for a SIGCONT that never comes,
 *     and only SIGKILL ends a stopped process;
 *  5. a process started from the folder and still running is missed;
 *  6. a process whose command line names another folder, whose name only
 *     begins like this one's (run-1 beside run-10), is found, and ended;
 *  7. a process that ends on its own within the grace is counted as left: as
 *     the run ends, its workers' children read the end of their stdin and go;
 *  8. a fake agent's id, which the code under test starts and the test never
 *     sees, is not where the test's teardown reads it, so the teardown ends
 *     nothing;
 *  9. an id a teardown took is taken again by the next one, and ended again:
 *     on Windows another process may hold it by then, seen as new.
 * A zombie, exited and not yet reaped, has no command line any more (ps shows
 * `<defunct>` on macOS and Linux), so no folder can be read from it; the code
 * skips one all the same where a ps would show it.
