/**
 * The witness for run-dir.ts: the temp dir every test file is handed.
 *
 * How it can fail:
 *  1. on Windows the run's folder keeps a %TEMP% spelled otherwise than the
 *     disk spells it (CI's 8.3 C:\Users\RUNNER~1, another case, a junction),
 *     and every test that builds a path from os.tmpdir() compares it with the
 *     canonical one git, the release scripts and the Claude project decoder
 *     report (CI run 36232894943, 15 tests);
 *  2. on macOS or Linux the temp dir is canonicalised too, and /var/folders
 *     becomes /private/var/folders under tests written against the first;
 *  3. the parent is canonicalised but the folder the workers get is not the
 *     one made under it.
