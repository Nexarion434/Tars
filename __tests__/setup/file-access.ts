 * never meant to cause. There an access control entry denies this account the

 * still gives its size, times and id and can still be replaced, as with mode
 * 0000; a folder denied new files still lists and still reads. The failure
 * there is EPERM where POSIX says EACCES.

 * violation (EBUSY in Node), and sharing is enforced whatever the privileges.
 * The access control entry of makeUnreadable was not enough there: on CI's
 * windows-latest, whose account is an administrator, the E2E app read a file
 * denied that way and priced its turn (run 36242089925), while the unit tests'
 * own reads of one were refused. The first version of this holder did no
 * better there (run 36245102646, 22.5k tokens again): a PowerShell statement
 * list goes on after a failed open, so it said 'held' holding nothing, which
 * it does here too when another process has the file open. It now fails with
 * the reason when it cannot hold the file within 15 s, and the file is read
 * once from this process before the test relies on it being unreadable. That
 * check caught the next run (36248702474): the file read while the holder had
 * said 'held'. The holder now also locks the file's whole length, and no longer
 * waits on its stdin, which it had no need of; it is ended by its handle.
