/**
 * Quitting Tars with its terminals running ends the app at once, cleanly, and
 * everything it started with it.
 *
 * Found by win-qa on 2026-09-27: a quit took 16 to 67 s under load, once about
 * an hour, although before-quit, will-quit and exit all ran within 142 ms, and
 * electron.exe outlived its `exit` event. Measured here (win-process), two
 * causes, one of them the app's:
 * - Killing a ConPTY terminal closes its pseudo console, and its shell exits a
 *   moment later, while Electron tears Node down: node-pty's exit thread then
 *   calls into it. electron.exe started directly with 6 terminals ended at
 *   before-quit, idle: 7 quits of 10 hung until killed, 3 ended in 0xC0000409;
 *   under 8 busy loops 4 of 5 crashed. After a crash Windows Error Reporting
 *   holds the dying process (and its profile) for as long as it takes to write
 *   its report.
 * - On a machine whose every core runs a busy loop, Chromium's own shutdown
 *   waits on children whose threads it has put at idle priority: a bare
 *   Electron 44 app, one blank window and nothing of Tars, took 20 to 59 s to
 *   quit under 8 busy loops (85 ms idle), and Tars with no terminal 43 to 87 s.
 *   Not the app's: with E2E_QUIT_LOAD set, the times are recorded, not held
 *   against it.
 *
 * How it fails, written before the fix:
 * 1. The app does not exit cleanly: its exit code is not 0 (0xC0000409 is the
 *    crash on the way out).
 * 2. Idle, the app's own `exit` comes later than MAIN_EXIT_BUDGET_MS after
 *    the quit (app.quit(), as Quit Tars).
 * 2b. The hang: the main process, or anything the app started, is still alive
 *    AFTER_EXIT_BUDGET_MS past the app's own `exit`, named by pid and creation
 *    time so a reused pid is never counted. The hang lasted until the process
 *    was killed; the bound is well past the slowest clean quit measured on a
 *    loaded machine (11.3 s from quit to main exit, the `exit` mark at 0.8 s,
 *    2026-09-28, about 74 electron and node processes of other runs beside it).
 *    The main process itself, where the hang lived, is held tighter:
 *    MAIN_AFTER_EXIT_BUDGET_MS past `exit`. Its time from the quit is
 *    recorded (mainExitMs), not held against the app: past `exit` it is
 *    Chromium's shutdown, starved on a busy machine (below).
 * 3. Something the app started (a terminal's shell or CLI, a console list
 *    helper, a Chromium child) is still alive AFTER_EXIT_BUDGET_MS past the
 *    app's `exit` (2b). How long each ran on after the main process exited
 *    is recorded (leftovers, over LEFTOVER_BUDGET_MS), not held: on a loaded
 *    machine a Chromium utility process was measured at 17.6 s past a main
 *    exit that had itself taken 10.8 s, a clean quit (2026-09-28).
 * 4. A terminal's shell outlives the quit (the guarantee D6 asserts, kept).
 * 5. The profile cannot be removed once everything has ended (EBUSY).
 * The race does not lose every time, so the spec quits QUITS times (6), each
 * in a fresh app: on the old build 8 idle quits of 16 exited 0xC0000409, and
 * each of three runs of this spec failed.
 *
 *   E2E_PORT_OFFSET=40 npx playwright test e2e/quit-time.win32.spec.ts
 *   E2E_QUIT_LOAD=8 ...  the same on a busy machine, times recorded only
