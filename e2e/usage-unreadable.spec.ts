 * The Usage page saying what it could not read.

 * Tars prices agents by replaying the transcripts Claude Code writes, and a
 * file it cannot open contributes nothing. The total went on presenting itself
 * as the total: the one failure that arrives as a smaller bill rather than as a
 * gap, which is why nobody ever reported it.
 *
 * Driven through the real app because every part of this is renderer: the suite
 * runs in `node` with no DOM, so a hook or a page cannot be rendered. Going end
 * to end proves what matters anyway, which is the whole chain from a file the
 * process cannot open to the sentence under the subtitle.
