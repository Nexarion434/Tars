/**
 * Saving the Settings page must not write back what nobody touched.
 *
 * The page used to send the whole snapshot it loaded when it opened, and the
 * main process merges what arrives onto the file, so every key in that payload
 * won: the ones the user never went near, and the ones something else had
 * written since. The main process now refuses an empty `hooks`, an empty `env`
 * and empty permissions, because empty is a shape it can recognise. It cannot
 * do the same for `includeCoAuthoredBy`: a stale `false` and a chosen `false`
 * are the same two bytes. Only leaving a key out of the payload settles it.
 *
 * Driven through the real app rather than through the hook, because there is
 * no way to drive the hook: the suite runs in `node` with no DOM and no
 * testing-library, and `renderToStaticMarkup` cannot take a component through
 * a state change. Going end to end also proves the part that matters, which is
 * the whole chain from the toggle to the bytes on disk.
 *
 * The Co-authored-by toggle is the only control wired to `updateSettings`, so
 * it is the only key a save can legitimately carry today.
