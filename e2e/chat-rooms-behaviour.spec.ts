/**
 * What a Chat room does, where chat-rooms.spec.ts photographs what it shows.
 *
 * Written before the fixes, each test red on main at 00c7fc40 (1.8.0). The ways
 * a room fails that these pin:
 *
 * 1. A draft follows you into the next room. The room view stayed mounted from
 *    one room to the next, so the words typed in orion were in the composer of
 *    tars once tars opened, and Enter posted them to tars, whose agents were
 *    never meant to read them.
 * 2. An error hides behind "no turn signal". The team rail asked whether the
 *    CLI reports its turns before it asked about an error, so an agent on grok
 *    whose session failed read "no turn signal" and "Tars sees its output, not
 *    its turns", and the reason it failed was nowhere on the page.
 * 3. The older messages of a busy room are out of reach. The thread was a scroll
 *    box that was also `justify-end`, so what overflowed went above its top,
 *    where no scroll reaches: QA measured 30 messages in tars, the first 2584 px
 *    above the thread and the wheel moving nothing.
 * 4. The room list stays empty after a slow start. It was read once and given
 *    10 s; an answer after that was thrown away, and a refused read was not
 *    sent again, so the note "The bus did not answer" stood where the rows
 *    would be until a click on retry or a message (red on 1.9.1).
 *
 * Same sandbox as chat-rooms.spec.ts: the seeded journal, nothing started. The
 * statuses a test needs are set on the app's own agent map and pushed with a
 * tick, as a hook would.
