/**
 * How far a screenshot may drift from its reference before the surface fails.
 * One number, used by every spec that photographs the app.
 *
 * It was `maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.002`, which is 2,592 pixels of a 1440x900 page:
 * more than a row of content costs, and at the final sweep of 1.7.1 sixteen
 * surfaces differed from their references underneath it, `settings-system`
 * still showing version 1.6.3. A tolerance above what a real change costs
 * cannot fail on one.
 *
 * Measured on 2026-09-17, four full passes of the same tree (2f734fb), 45
 * captures each, every pair compared with Playwright's own comparator at its
 * default per-pixel threshold: **0 pixels** differ, on every surface but five,
 * and all five showed content that moves on its own (a random sandbox path, a
 * chunk count, a terminal line, two rooms named after a temp directory). Those
 * are masked below, by locator, so there is no measured noise left to tolerate.
 *
 * What a real change costs, measured against the references the same day:
 * **one character** of a page subtitle, 11 pixels; three characters of a
 * provider count, 18; three digits of a plugin count, 42; every dropdown's text
 * moved by four pixels, 152; a delete button added to six agent cards, 518.
 *
 * So: 10 pixels. Above the measured noise of zero, by room for a stray pixel,
 * and under the smallest change anybody can make to a page, by one pixel: a
 * single letter of `subtitle="Recurring jobs running in your Hermes gateway."`,
 * changed in a copy and never committed, failed `crons` at 11 pixels. A change
 * of one thin character could still come in under this, which is the honest
 * limit of a per-pixel count.
 *
 * The per-pixel threshold stays at Playwright's default, and that is where the
 * remaining blind spot is: pixelmatch does not count a colour change smaller
 * than it, so a scrollbar appearing inside a terminal is invisible here (1,977
 * pixels at a threshold of 0.1, 0 at 0.2). Lowering it would turn that same
 * scrollbar into run-to-run noise, since it depends on how much a live CLI has
 * printed; the terminal bodies are masked instead.

/**
 * Content that changes without anybody changing the app, masked by locator.
 *
 * A reference that carries a clock, a version number or a path made of a random
 * temp directory cannot match twice, and the answer used to be either a
 * tolerance wide enough to hide real changes or a re-record every release.
 * Each entry says what it covers and where, and specs pass the selector to
 * page.locator.
 *
 * `surfaces: 'all'` is everywhere, a list is those surfaces only: a selector
 * aimed at one page must not hide content on another. The keys are recorded as
 * they match, and e2e/known-errors.spec.ts fails a full run in which one of
 * them matched nothing anywhere, because a mask that stops matching hides
 * nothing and says nothing.
 *
 * A mask is painted magenta, and its shade is not fixed: (255, 0, 255) in the
 * references recorded before 1.8.0, (234, 51, 247) in those recorded on
 * Electron 44 for it (#173), and two runs a day apart have shown either. Mask
 * against mask stays under the per-pixel threshold, so Playwright counts none
 * of it; a count made by hand (the regions of the final runs of 1.8.0 and
 * 1.8.1) must skip a pixel that is magenta on both sides, red and blue above
 * 200 and green below 90, or it reports every mask as a change.
