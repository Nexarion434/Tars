/**
 * The page must never scroll sideways, with every dropdown open or shut.
 *
 * Two things made this worth asserting rather than eyeballing. The Usage hover
 * cards used to hang off the right of the last bars and widen the document, and
 * the fix for that is an anchoring rule plus `overflow-x-clip` that only a
 * measurement can prove. And the shared `Dropdown` panel is now sized by its
 * content instead of by its trigger, so any picker sitting near the right edge
 * can push the document wider than the window. One is the requirement, the
 * other is the regression it invites, and both show up as the same number.
 *
 * Measured on the real Electron window, not a jsdom guess.
