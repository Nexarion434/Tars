/**
 * Visual + technical sweep of the real Electron app.
 *
 * The app boots sandboxed through launchSandboxed in fixture.mjs: HOME points
 * at a temp dir, so ~/.dorothy and ~/.claude are test fixtures, its Chromium
 * profile is moved there too, which HOME alone does not do, and the API binds
 * a dedicated port.
 *
 * For each surface in e2e/surfaces.mjs:
 *  - navigate (and click through to overlays / settings sections)
 *  - assert zero uncaught page errors        ← technical check
 *  - compare a screenshot against baseline   ← design check
