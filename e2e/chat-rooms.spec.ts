/**
 * The Chat room, one frame per state, in a sandbox of its own.
 *
 * A room is derived from a project rather than stored, and its state comes
 * from the bus journal, so five states means five rooms and a seeded journal.
 * That sandbox cannot be the sweep's: three more projects and six more agents
 * would move every baseline in it, and autostart would run each of those
 * agents as a real CLI, which makes `all stopped` impossible to photograph.
 *
 * What this pins that nothing else did: `delivered`, `dropped`, `bounded` and
 * `superseded` are rendered here for the first time. They were states the page
 * had code for and no data had ever produced, which is not the same as a state
 * that works.
